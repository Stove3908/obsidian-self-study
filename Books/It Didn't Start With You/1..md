---
## Content:
- Inherited trauma (also known as generational or transgenerational trauma) refers to the transmission of the psychological, behavioral, and potentially biological effects of trauma from one generation to the next. 
- This means descendants of trauma survivors can exhibit trauma-related symptoms even if they did not directly experience the original event. 
- The scope includes emotional patterns, behavioral tendencies, and physiological predispositions.
