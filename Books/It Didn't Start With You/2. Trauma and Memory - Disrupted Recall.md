## Content

- Trauma disrupts the ability to articulate experiences.
- Thought processes become scattered, and memories are stored as fragmented images, body sensations, and words in the unconscious. 
- These fragments can be triggered by reminders of the original event, leading to unconscious reenactment of aspects of the trauma. 
- The speech center and medial prefrontal cortex (responsible for experiencing the present moment) shut down during trauma, hindering the ability to think and speak clearly about the event.
