**8. Resilience: A Legacy of Strength**

## Content

- While trauma can create a legacy of distress, it can also forge a legacy of strength and resilience that can be felt for generations to come. 
- Epigenetic changes resulting from trauma can expand the range of ways individuals respond in stressful situations, potentially leading to increased resourcefulness and the ability to cope with adversity.
