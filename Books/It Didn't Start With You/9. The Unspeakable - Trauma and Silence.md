## Content

- When trauma is too great to manage or resolve, individuals tend to avoid it.
- Blocking the feelings associated with trauma can stunt the necessary healing process. 
- Often, the pain submerges until it can find a pathway for expression or resolution, frequently resurfacing in subsequent generations as difficult-to-explain symptoms. 
- Extreme trauma often leads to silence and avoidance within families, preventing open discussion and processing of the events.
