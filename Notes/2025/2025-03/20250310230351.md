## 5. Caveats about Control ^aa909e29-a138-8e17
- **A. Natural Aptitudes and Differences:**
	- Enormous differences exist in people's natural aptitudes.
	- Brains work differently (processing speeds, memory, tolerance for stress).
	- You can work hard and still not get what you want.
- **B. Focus on Response to Setbacks:**
	- The real question is, what do you make of a setback?
	- Do you take it as a verdict on your worth?
	- Do you decide to come up with a different strategy?
	- Do you take the hit and try for a different goal?
- **C. College Admissions Example:**
	- The idea that the admissions process is a pure meritocracy is stressful and untrue.
	- Colleges value academic rigor, but also give preferential treatment to athletes, legacies, and diversity.
	- Many factors are outside of your control (applicant pool, admissions rep's mood).
	- Don't believe you can control the uncontrollable.
- **D. Goal: Increase Stress Tolerance:**
	- Help kids increase their stress tolerance (ability to perform well in stressful situations).
	- Help them "throw off" stress rather than accumulate it.
	- Challenge kids without overwhelming them.
	- Stretch them without breaking them.
	- Give their brains all the support and room they need to grow strong.
