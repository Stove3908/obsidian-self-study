Sure! Here are the detailed points for the first branch, **Emotional Loneliness**:

- **Emotional Loneliness**
    - **Definition and Causes**: 
	    - Emotional loneliness arises from a lack of emotional intimacy with others.
	    - It can begin in childhood if a child feels emotionally unseen by self-preoccupied parents or can develop in adulthood when an emotional connection is lost. 
	    - This feeling is often vague and private, making it difficult to describe or identify.
    - **Impact on Children and Adults**: 
	    - Growing up with emotionally immature parents can lead to a lifelong sense of emotional loneliness. 
	    - These parents may provide for their child's physical needs but fail to make a solid emotional connection, leaving the child with a sense of emptiness. 
	    - This core emptiness can persist into adulthood, affecting relationships and leading to a continuous feeling of emotional isolation.
    - **Experiences of Emotional Loneliness**: 
	    - Emotional loneliness is a fundamental pain, similar to physical injury, but it doesn't show on the outside. 
	    - It can be described as a feeling of emptiness or being alone in the world. 
	    - Children have no way of identifying a lack of emotional intimacy in their relationship with a parent, and they may not understand that their parents are emotionally immature.
    - **Stories of David and Rhonda**: 
	    - David described his childhood as incredibly lonely, feeling utterly isolated and emotionally disconnected from his family. 
	    - Rhonda, on the other hand, remembered feeling totally alone during a family move, despite being physically present with her family. 
	    - Both stories illustrate the profound impact of emotional loneliness on children.
