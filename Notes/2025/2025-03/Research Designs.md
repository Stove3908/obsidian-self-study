- **Repeated Measures**:
    - Same participants measured twice (e.g., before/after intervention).
    - Example: Police officersâ€™ license plate recall before vs. after training.
- **Matched Pairs**:
    - Different participants matched on key variables (e.g., age, IQ).
    - Example: Twins assigned to different treatment groups.
