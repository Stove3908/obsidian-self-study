[[It Didn't Start With You]]
[[11.2]]

- **Foundation of Life Perception**:
    
    - The mother is the child’s “whole world” in infancy, shaping their earliest understanding of safety, trust, and belonging.
    - Her touch, gaze, scent, and emotional attunement act as the child’s lifeline, mirroring experiences into digestible doses (e.g., concern when the child cries, delight when they laugh).
- **Prenatal Influence**:
    
    - Begins in the womb: The mother’s emotional state (stress, anxiety, joy) permeates the prenatal environment, influencing the child’s temperament (calm vs. troubled, resilient vs. inflexible).
    - Negative patterns (e.g., chronic maternal fear or grief) can create a predisposition to anxiety or distrust.
- **Reservoir of "Good Stuff"**:
    
    - A well-attuned mother fills the child with a “reservoir of good feeling” through consistent care, warmth, and responsiveness.
    - This reservoir allows the child to trust life’s flow, believing “I am enough” and “life will provide.”
    - **Consequences of Deprivation**:
        - Insufficient “good stuff” leads to scarcity mindsets (“I’ll never get enough”) and distrust in life’s benevolence.
        - Interruptions in bonding (e.g., trauma, detachment) create a void, manifesting as fear, rage, or numbness.
- **Mirroring & Attunement**:
    
    - Mother’s role as an emotional mirror: Reflects the child’s experiences, helping them regulate emotions and build self-awareness.
    - **Disrupted Attunement**:
        - Maternal emotional absence (e.g., due to grief, depression) leaves the child unable to process feelings, leading to helplessness or hypervigilance.
        - Temporary disruptions are manageable if repaired (e.g., mother calmly reconnecting after a separation).
- **Blueprint for Relationships**:
    
    - The bond becomes a template for future relationships. A secure bond fosters empathy, while interruptions seed fear of abandonment or rejection.
    - **Self-Perception**:
        - Secure attachment → “I am worthy of love; others are trustworthy.”
        - Broken bond → Core beliefs like “I’m not enough” or “I’ll be abandoned.”
- **Repair & Resilience**:
    
    - Even brief disruptions (e.g., hospitalizations, maternal stress) can fragment the bond, but repair is possible at any life stage.
    - Healing involves rebuilding trust through self-awareness (e.g., identifying core language) and symbolic reconnection (e.g., inner-child work).
- **Metaphorical Link to Life**:
    
    - The mother’s care is intertwined with the child’s perception of life itself. A stable bond fosters trust that “life supports me”; a broken bond breeds existential anxiety.
