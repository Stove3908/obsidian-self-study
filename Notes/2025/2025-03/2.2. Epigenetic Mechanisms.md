[[2.3. Animal Research Findings]]


#### **DNA Methylation**

- **Process**:
    - Methyl groups attach to DNA, suppressing gene expression (e.g., silencing stress-response genes).
    - Escapes "reprogramming" during fertilization, allowing inherited stress patterns.
- **Key Studies**:
    - **Yehuda’s Holocaust Study (2015)**:
        - Survivors and their children shared identical methylation patterns in the _FKBP5_ gene (linked to PTSD and cortisol regulation).
        - Changes observed _only_ in families exposed to trauma (not in control groups).
    - **9/11 Study**:
        - Mothers with PTSD had children with low cortisol levels and 16 differentially expressed genes.
        - Children exhibited hypervigilance (e.g., distress at loud noises).



#### **MicroRNA**

- **Role**: Noncoding RNA molecules regulate gene expression by blocking mRNA.
- **Animal Research**:
    - **Mansuy’s Mouse Study (2014)**:
        - Traumatized males passed stress behaviors (e.g., depression) to 3 generations.
        - High microRNA levels found in sperm, blood, and hippocampi of offspring.
    - **Zaidan’s Rat Study (2013)**:
        - Mild stress in adolescent female rats altered CRF1 gene expression in their eggs and offspring.
        - Changes occurred _independently_ of maternal care post-birth.



#### **Key Genes Affected**

- **CRF1/CRF2**:
    - Encode corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors (regulate stress response).
    - Elevated in depression/anxiety; inherited via maternal eggs (Zaidan study).
- **FKBP5**:
    - Modifies glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity (cortisol regulation).
    - Methylation changes linked to transgenerational PTSD (Yehuda’s Holocaust study).



#### **Rachel Yehuda’s Research**

- **Parental PTSD Transmission**:
    - **Maternal PTSD**: Children struggle to self-soothe; mothers often overattached (e.g., Holocaust survivors’ fear of losing children).
    - **Paternal PTSD**: Children prone to dissociation, chronic stress, and depression.
- **Generational Timing**:
    - Maternal trauma during _childhood_ vs. _adulthood_ alters cortisol metabolism differently in offspring.
- **Human vs. Animal Findings**:
    - Confirmed 3–4 generation epigenetic effects in humans (mirroring mouse studies).



#### **Environmental Mismatch**

- **Adaptive vs. Harmful**:
    - Epigenetic changes prepare offspring for similar stressors (e.g., warzone startle reflexes).
    - **Mismatch Example**: A child inherits hypervigilance but grows up in safety → chronic anxiety, immune dysfunction.
- **Stress Disorders**:
    - High rates of PTSD, addiction, and suicide in descendants of Cambodian genocide survivors, Native American tribes, and Rwandan youth.
