# Chapter 1. Traumas Lost and Found
### Introduction to Trauma
- **Quote by William Faulkner**: "The past is never dead. Itâ€™s not even past."
- **Inability to Articulate Trauma**:
    - Trauma often leaves individuals unable to express what happened.
    - Loss of words and disorganized thought processes during traumatic incidents.
- **Memory Fragmentation**:
    - Memories of trauma are stored as fragmented images, body sensations, and words.
    - These fragments can be triggered later by anything reminiscent of the original event.
    - Triggering causes reenactment of aspects of the original trauma in daily life.



### Historical Perspectives

- **Sigmund Freud's "Repetition Compulsion"**:
    
    - Freud identified the pattern of traumatic reenactment, calling it "repetition compulsion."
    - This is an unconscious attempt to replay unresolved events to "get it right."
    - Families may repeat unresolved traumas across generations.
- **Carl Jung's Views on Unconscious Patterns**:
    
    - Jung believed that what remains unconscious resurfaces in our lives as fate.
    - Unconscious patterns are likely to repeat until they are brought into awareness.
    - Both Freud and Jung noted that difficult-to-process experiences are stored in the unconscious.



### Modern Research on Trauma

- **Bessel van der Kolk's Findings on Brain Function During Trauma**:
    
    - Advances in imaging technology have revealed how brain and bodily functions misfire during trauma.
    - Bessel van der Kolk, a Dutch psychiatrist, has conducted significant research on posttraumatic stress.
    - During trauma, the speech center and medial prefrontal cortex (responsible for experiencing the present moment) shut down.
- **Speechless Terror and Brain Pathways**:
    
    - Van der Kolk describes the "speechless terror" of trauma, where individuals are at a loss for words.
    - Brain pathways for remembering are hindered during periods of threat or danger.
    - When reliving traumatic experiences, the frontal lobes become impaired, making it difficult to think and speak.
    - This impairment prevents individuals from communicating their experiences to themselves or others.



### Family and Generational Trauma

- **Impact of Family and Social History**:
    
    - Emerging trends in psychotherapy include traumatic events in family and social history as part of the whole picture.
    - Tragedies such as abandonment, suicide, war, or the early death of a family member can send shock waves of distress across generations.
    - Exploring at least three generations of family history is important to understand patterns of trauma and suffering.
- **Examples of Generational Trauma**:
    
    - **Jesse's Story**:
	    - Jesse suffered from insomnia triggered by an unconscious connection to his uncle's death.
	    - His uncle, Colin, froze to death at the age of nineteen, and Jesse unconsciously relived aspects of this trauma.
	    - Making the connection helped Jesse begin the healing process.
    - **Gretchen's Story**:
	    - Gretchen struggled with depression and anxiety, which were linked to her grandmother's Holocaust trauma.
	    - Her grandmother's family perished in Auschwitz, and the trauma was never spoken about.
	    - Understanding the connection helped Gretchen make sense of her suffering and begin to heal.



### Scientific Evidence

- **Rachel Yehuda's Research on PTSD and Cortisol Levels**:
    
    - Rachel Yehuda is a leading expert in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and has conducted extensive research on the neurobiology of PTSD.
    - Her studies focus on Holocaust survivors and their children, examining the effects of trauma on cortisol levels (the stress hormone).
    - Yehuda found that children of Holocaust survivors with PTSD were born with low cortisol levels, similar to their parents.
    - This predisposes them to relive PTSD symptoms of the previous generation.
- **Biological Markers of Inherited Trauma**:
    
    - Yehuda's research challenges the notion that stress is always associated with high cortisol levels.
    - In cases of chronic PTSD, cortisol production can become suppressed, leading to low levels in both survivors and their children.
    - Similar low cortisol levels were found in war veterans and pregnant mothers who developed PTSD after the World Trade Center attacks, as well as in their children.
    - Yehuda's findings suggest that generational PTSD is inherited rather than solely a result of exposure to parents' stories.
    - Her work demonstrates that descendants of trauma survivors carry physical and emotional symptoms of traumas they have not directly experienced.



### Healing and Integration

- **Therapeutic Approaches to Processing Trauma**:
    
    - Healing trauma often involves bringing unconscious patterns into awareness.
    - Therapists use various techniques to help clients process and integrate traumatic experiences.
    - Examples include talk therapy, cognitive approaches, and experiential methods.
- **Importance of Visceral Experiences in Healing**:
    
    - Intellectual understanding alone is rarely enough for lasting healing.
    - A deeply felt visceral experience is often necessary to fully integrate and release trauma.
    - Techniques such as guided imagery, role-playing, and body-focused therapies can help clients access and process buried emotions and sensations.



### Positive Aspects of Trauma

- **Epigenetic Changes and Resilience**:
    
    - Traumatic events can lead to epigenetic changes, which are chemical modifications in our cells.
    - These changes can expand the range of ways we respond to stressful situations, potentially increasing resilience.
    - Rachel Yehuda suggests that previous adversity can prepare individuals to better handle future challenges.
- **Rachel Yehuda's Perspective on Adversity**:
    
    - Yehuda emphasizes the potential positive outcomes of experiencing and inheriting trauma.
    - She argues that understanding the biological changes from stress and trauma can help us recognize our true capabilities and potentials.
    - Traumas can create a legacy of strength and resilience that benefits future generations.
