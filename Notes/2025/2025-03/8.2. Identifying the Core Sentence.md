[[8.3. Fine-Tuning the Core Sentence]]

## **2. Identifying the Core Sentence**  
_(Expanded Details)_

- **Exercises**:
    - **Written Exercise #6**:
        - Direct prompt: _“My worst fear, the worst thing that could happen to me, is…”_
        - Goal: Initial articulation of fear without overthinking (e.g., “I’ll be rejected,” “They’ll hurt me”).
    - **Written Exercise #7**:
        - _Tweaking syntax_: Experiment with sentence starters like “I could…”, “They might…”, or “My family will…” to refine emotional accuracy.
        - Example: Shifting from “I’ll fail” to “I’ll disappoint everyone” for deeper resonance.
    - **Written Exercise #8**:
        - _Layered questioning_: Ask, _“If that happened, what’s the worst part?”_ to drill down (e.g., “I’ll die” → “My children will forget me”).
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Brevity**: Typically 3–6 words (e.g., “I’m invisible,” “They’ll destroy me”).
    - **Tense**: Often future/present tense to evoke immediacy (e.g., “I’m trapped” vs. “I was trapped”).
    - **Somatic feedback**: Physical reactions (e.g., nausea, tingling, tears) signal alignment with the true core sentence.
- **Examples from Text**:
    - **Gretchen**: “I’ll vaporize myself” tied to Holocaust incineration trauma.
    - **Steve**: “I’ll disappear” mirroring family erased in concentration camps.
    - **Linda**: “They’ll kidnap me” echoing her great-aunt’s abduction and murder.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
    - **Overthinking**: Core sentences emerge from instinct, not logic.
    - **Avoidance**: Fear of “owning” the sentence (e.g., “I’ll hurt my child” feels too shameful to voice).
- **Validation**:
    - **Test for resonance**: Speak the sentence aloud; if it feels “alive” in the body, it’s likely accurate.
    - **Cross-reference**: Compare with family history to confirm links (e.g., Zach’s “I need to die” tied to grandfather’s unpunished crimes).
