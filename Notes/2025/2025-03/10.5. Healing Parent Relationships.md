    - _Question_: “What pain made them unable to love me the way I needed?”
2. **Reframe the Narrative**:
    - _Shift_: From “My mother was cruel” to “My mother survived cruelty.”
3. **Internal Reconciliation**:
    - _Practice_: Visualize parents as wounded children before engaging in healing dialogues.
