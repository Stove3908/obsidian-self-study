- **Repetition of Past Patterns**
    - **Why People Repeat Past Patterns**: 
	    - The lack of emotional connection with emotionally immature parents is painful, yet many people end up in similarly frustrating relationships in adulthood. 
	    - This happens because the most primitive parts of our brain tell us that safety lies in familiarity. 
	    - We gravitate to situations we have experience with because we know how to deal with them. 
	    - As children, we don't recognize our parents' limitations because seeing them as immature or flawed is frightening.
	    - By denying the painful truth about our parents, we aren't able to recognize similarly hurtful people in future relationships.
	    - Denial makes us repeat the same situation over and over because we never see it coming the next time.
    - **Story of Sophie**: 
	    - Sophie had been dating Jerry for five years and wanted to get married, but Jerry was in no hurry.
	    - He didn't seem to want emotional intimacy and usually closed down when Sophie brought up emotional topics. 
	    - Sophie felt deeply frustrated and sought therapy for help.
	    - One day, Jerry suggested they go to the restaurant they had gone to on their first date, making Sophie wonder if he might propose. 
	    - However, instead of a proposal, Jerry presented a joke that left Sophie shocked, furious, and deeply hurt.
	    - When she called her mother, her mother sided with Jerry, invalidating Sophie's feelings. 
	    - In therapy, Sophie realized the parallels between her mother's lack of empathy and Jerry's emotional insensitivity. 
	    - She saw that her frustration with Jerry's emotional unavailability was as old as her childhood, reentering the emotional loneliness she had felt as a child.
