## **1. Core Trauma Definition**  
**(Expanded Details)**

- **Nature of Core Trauma**:
    
    - _Unresolved emotional pain_: Trauma that remains unprocessed, often buried or silenced across generations.
    - _Intergenerational transmission_: Passed down through family systems, affecting descendants’ emotions, behaviors, or physical health.
    - _Persistent emotional legacy_: Described as “haunting” the family until its story is acknowledged (e.g., Carole’s weight linked to her grandmother’s guilt).
- **Origins**:
    
    - Rooted in _ancestral or childhood events_: Traumatic experiences (e.g., war crimes, untimely deaths, institutionalization) that were never fully addressed.
    - _Family silence/secrecy_: Events shrouded in shame, guilt, or denial (e.g., Zach’s grandfather’s actions under Mussolini).
    - _Lack of mourning_: Absence of rituals or acknowledgment to process loss (e.g., Lisa’s grandparents’ unspoken grief over lost children).
- **Manifestations**:
    
    - _Psychological_: Fears, phobias, or irrational beliefs (e.g., Ellie’s fear of “going crazy” mirroring her great-aunt’s institutionalization).
    - _Somatic_: Physical symptoms or behaviors (e.g., Carole’s weight gain as a metaphor for her grandmother’s “smothered” children).
    - _Unconscious identification_: Adopting a family member’s fate or emotions (e.g., Zach’s fear of punishment echoing his grandfather’s unconfessed crimes).
- **Healing Imperative**:
    
    - _Storytelling as resolution_: Judith Herman’s quote underscores that traumas “refuse to be buried” until narratives are shared.
    - _Breaking cycles_: Acknowledgment disrupts intergenerational patterns (e.g., Carole’s emotional release after linking her struggle to her grandmother’s trauma).
    - _Reclaiming agency_: Separating one’s identity from inherited pain (e.g., Lisa recognizing her fear belonged to her grandparents, not her).
- **Key Insight**:  
    Core trauma is not static—it _seeks resolution_ through descendants, who unconsciously carry its weight until it is brought to light.
