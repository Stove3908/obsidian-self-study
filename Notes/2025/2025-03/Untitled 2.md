# Assignment Part 2

## Requirements

### Random Sampling in SPSS

#### Use `Data > Select Cases > Random Sample` to generate a subsample.

#### Ensure sample size aligns with assignment instructions (e.g., 15% of total data).

### Four Questions

#### Q1: One-Sample t-Test (Week 6)

##### Compare a sample mean to a known population mean (e.g., _"Is average weekly takeaway spend different from $30?"_).

##### SPSS Steps: `Analyze > Compare Means > One-Sample T Test`.

#### Q2: Independent Samples t-Test (Week 7)

##### Compare two unrelated groups (e.g., _"Do males and females differ in weekly takeaway spend?"_).

##### SPSS Steps: `Analyze > Compare Means > Independent Samples T Test`.

#### Q3: Paired Samples t-Test (Week 8)

##### Compare related measures (e.g., _"Does happiness differ when living alone vs. with family?"_).

##### SPSS Steps: `Transform > Compute Variable` (create difference scores) → `Analyze > Compare Means > Paired T Test`.

#### Q4: Short Answer (Week 5)

##### May cover hypothesis testing, Type I/II errors, or p-value interpretation (e.g., _"Explain why we reject $H_0$ if $p<\alpha$."_).



## Key Tips for Success

### Assumption Checks

#### One-Sample t-Test

##### Normality of the sample (histogram/Shapiro-Wilk).

#### Independent t-Test

##### Normality + homogeneity of variance (Levene’s test).

#### Paired t-Test

##### Normality of difference scores.

### APA-Style Reporting

#### For all t-tests: Include $M$, $SD$, $t$-value, $df$, $p$, and 95% CI.

#### Example: _"Males ($M=35.26$, $SD=30.80$) did not significantly differ from females ($M=33.79$, $SD=30.20$) in takeaway spend, $t(223)=0.36$, $p=.719$, 95% CI [-6.57, 9.50]."_

### Structure Reports Clearly

#### Introduction

##### Hypothesis.

#### Methods

##### Sample size, test used.

#### Results

##### Descriptive stats, test results.

#### Conclusion

##### Link results to hypothesis.



## Examples from Lecture

### Q1 (One-Sample t-Test)

#### _"Test if Swinburne students’ average sleep hours differ from 7 hours."_

#### SPSS Output: Population mean = 7; Sample mean = 6.5, $t(224)=-1.23$, $p=.220$.

### Q2 (Independent t-Test)

#### _"Compare takeaway spend between domestic and international students."_

#### Key Output: Levene’s $p=.642$ (equal variances assumed).

### Q3 (Paired t-Test)

#### _"Compare pizza delivery times (Pizza Hut vs. Specialist Pizza)."_

#### Result: $t(37)=2.85$, $p=.007$, 95% CI [0.36, 2.12].

### Q4 (Short Answer)

#### _"Explain why a 95% CI that excludes 0 aligns with rejecting $H_0$."_



## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Incorrect Test Selection

#### Using independent t-test instead of paired (or vice versa).

### Misinterpreting p-Values

#### Claiming "no difference" if $p>\alpha$ (correct: "insufficient evidence").

### Overlooking Assumptions

#### Failing to check normality/heterogeneity (e.g., ignoring Levene’s test).

### Data Entry Errors

#### Incorrectly computing difference scores or selecting cases.



## Submission Checklist

### Random sample properly selected and justified.

### All tests include SPSS output screenshots.

### Assumptions clearly addressed (e.g., _"Histograms suggest normality."_).

### Responses adhere to word limits (if specified).
