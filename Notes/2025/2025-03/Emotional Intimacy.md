- Emotional Intimacy
    - **Importance of Emotional Intimacy**: 
	    - Emotional intimacy involves knowing that you have someone you can tell anything to, someone to go to with all your feelings, about anything and everything. 
	    - It creates a sense of being seen for who you really are and can only exist when the other person seeks to know you, not judge you.
	    - Emotional intimacy is profoundly fulfilling and is the basis for our security as children.
    - **Characteristics of Emotionally Mature Parents**:
	    - Emotionally mature parents engage in genuine emotional interactions with their children almost all the time. 
	    - They are comfortable with their own feelings and those of others, and they are emotionally attuned to their children. 
	    - These parents notice their children's moods, welcome their feelings with interest, and make their children feel safe connecting with them. 
	    - They are consistent in their attentiveness and interest, making them emotionally dependable.
