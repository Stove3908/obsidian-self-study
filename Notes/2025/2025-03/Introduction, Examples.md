### **Introduction/Examples**

#### **Adam’s Story**

- **Background**:
    - 15-year-old sophomore in underfunded Chicago public school.
    - Lives in South Side projects; daily walk to school reflects systemic inequities.
- **Trauma**:
    - Witnessed older brother’s death in a drive-by shooting _while together on a street corner_.
    - Lingering effects: Difficulty concentrating, explosive behavior, insomnia, declining grades.
- **Stressors**:
    - Chronic environmental stress (violence, poverty).
    - Lack of safety/security; grief unresolved due to systemic neglect.

#### **Zara’s Story**

- **Background**:
    - 15-year-old in affluent DC suburbs; attends elite private school.
    - Parents prioritize National Merit Scholarship (PSAT prep).
- **Pressure**:
    - Schedule: Test prep, field hockey, Habitat for Humanity volunteering, 3–4 hours nightly homework.
    - "Good grades" mask underlying strain: Sleep deprivation, headaches, irritability (snapping at parents/friends).
- **Stressors**:
    - Performance-driven culture; fear of failure ("If I sleep, someone else will take my Duke spot").
    - _Outward success vs. internalized anxiety_.

#### **Key Insight**:

- **Brain Scan Comparison**:
    - Adam and Zara’s brain scans show _striking similarities_ in stress-response regions (amygdala, prefrontal cortex).
    - **Authors’ Purpose**: Stress transcends socioeconomic status—chronic activation of stress systems harms _all_ brains.
- **Statistics**:
    - Affluent teens at high risk: 80% report moderate-severe anxiety, 54% depression (Silicon Valley study).
    - _Madeline Levine’s research_: Pressure to achieve + lack of autonomy → mental health crises.

#### **Broader Context**:

- **Authors’ Analogy**:
    - Stress as societal "climate change"—cumulative, intergenerational, requiring systemic change.
- **Takeaway**:
    - Toxic stress ≠ limited to poverty; hyper-achievement cultures equally damaging.
    - Both examples challenge stereotypes about who is "at risk."
