- During a traumatic event, the speech center and medial prefrontal cortex shut down.
    - Speech Center Shutdown → Leads to speechless terror, where individuals struggle to articulate their experiences.
    - Medial Prefrontal Cortex Shutdown → Impairs present-moment awareness, as this area helps people stay grounded in the "here and now."
        
- Impact: This explains why trauma survivors often feel disconnected or unable to describe what happened during and after the event.
