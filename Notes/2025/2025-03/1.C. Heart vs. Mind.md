    - "Getting to Yes": Groundbreaking treatise that changed the field
        
    - **Rational Problem-Solving Approach:**
        
        - Systematize problem-solving
        - Reach mutually beneficial deals ("getting to Yes")
        - Overcome the emotional brain through rationality
    - **Four Tenets:**
        
        - Separate the Person (Emotion) from the Problem
        - Focus on Interests (Why) Instead of Positions (What)
        - Work Cooperatively to Generate Win-Win Options
        - Establish Mutually Agreed-Upon Standards for Evaluation
- **Behavioral Economics (Kahneman & Tversky):**
    
    - University of Chicago Professors: Offered a different angle on economics and negotiation
        
    - Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman: Launched the field of behavioral economics
        
    - Kahneman's Nobel Prize: Awarded for his work in behavioral economics
        
    - **Irrationality of Humans:**
        
        - Man is a very irrational beast
        - Feeling is a form of thinking
        - People are neither fully rational nor completely selfish
    - **Cognitive Biases:**
        
        - Unconscious and irrational brain processes that distort our view of the world
            
        - Identified over 150 cognitive biases
            
        - **Examples:**
            
            - Framing Effect: Responses differ based on how choices are framed
            - Prospect Theory: Taking unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses
            - Loss Aversion: Avoiding a loss is more powerful than achieving an equal gain
    - **System 1 vs. System 2 Thinking (Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow"):**
        
        - System 1: Fast, instinctive, emotional (animal mind)
        - System 2: Slow, deliberative, logical
        - System 1 Dominance: Guides and steers rational thoughts
        - Influence on System 2: System 1 reactions inform and create System 2 answers
        - Implications for Negotiation: Affecting System 1 can modify System 2 responses
