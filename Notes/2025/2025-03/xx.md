Thinking...

> Okay, the user asked to add details to the fourth branch of the mindmap, which is **Peer Review & Feedback (D)**. From the original response, this branch covers the individual task of submitting peer/self-evaluations and providing constructive feedback. Let me think about how to expand this.
> 
> First, I need to consider the process of peer review as outlined in the assignment. Students must complete evaluations through Canvas, which are anonymous. The feedback needs to be respectful and constructive. The purpose is to assess each member's contribution and provide insights for improvement.
> 
> Expanding on the **Individual Task** sub-branch, I should detail what the evaluation form might include. Likely, criteria like responsibility, communication, quality of work, meeting deadlines. Also, rating scales or qualitative comments.
> 
> For **Constructive Feedback**, examples of what constitutes helpful versus non-helpful feedback. Emphasize specific instances, like "Member A consistently met deadlines" instead of vague statements. Also, how to handle conflicts or underperformance diplomatically.
> 
> **Self-Evaluation** is crucial. Students reflect on their own contributions, strengths, and areas to improve. They need to be honest about their role in the project's success or challenges.
> 
> **Submission Process**: How to access the form on Canvas, deadlines, and technical steps. Mention the anonymous reporting mechanism but how it's tracked for marks.
> 
> **Impact on Marks**: The assignment states that peer reviews affect individual scores, especially if discrepancies arise. So, explaining how negative feedback might lower one's grade despite group work.
> 
> **Best Practices**: Advise students to regularly communicate with peers, document contributions, and address issues early. This can lead to more accurate and fair evaluations.
> 
> Potential issues: Bias in feedback, lack of participation, or non-constructive comments. Suggesting ways to mitigate these, like using objective criteria.
> 
> Also, the assignment mentions that results are shared anonymously for improvement. Highlighting the learning aspect of peer reviews in team settings.
> 
> Need to structure all these points into clear sub-sections under the Peer Review branch, ensuring alignment with the assignment's requirements and practical advice for students.

**Expanded Details for Peer Review & Feedback (D):**

### **D1: Individual Task Requirements**

- **Peer Evaluation**:
    - Submit anonymous ratings for each team member via Canvas.
    - Criteria include:
        - **Contribution**: Quality and quantity of work (e.g., "Member X coded 80% of `process_eoi.php`").
        - **Communication**: Responsiveness in meetings and messaging platforms.
        - **Reliability**: Meeting deadlines (e.g., "Member Y submitted their tasks late twice").
        - **Collaboration**: Willingness to help others (e.g., "Member Z debugged SQL queries for the team").
    - Use a 5-point scale (1 = Poor, 5 = Excellent) or qualitative comments.
- **Self-Evaluation**:
    - Reflect on personal strengths (e.g., "I designed the database schema efficiently").
    - Identify areas for growth (e.g., "I could improve time management").

### **D2: Constructive Feedback Guidelines**

- **Effective Feedback Examples**:
    - **Positive**:
        - "Member A’s validation logic in `process_eoi.php` ensured data integrity."
        - "Member B’s CSS made the site mobile-friendly."
    - **Constructive Criticism**:
        - "Member C could improve by documenting code for easier collaboration."
        - "Member D missed two meetings; better communication would help."
- **Avoid**:
    - Vague statements: "Member E did okay."
    - Personal attacks: "Member F is lazy."

---

### **D3: Submission Process**

- **Canvas Form**:
    - Accessed via "Project Part 2" > "Peer & Self Evaluation."
    - Anonymous submission to protect privacy.
    - Deadline matches project submission (Week 12).
- **Post-Submission**:
    - Instructors compile feedback and share anonymized summaries.
    - Used to adjust individual marks if contribution discrepancies exist.

---

### **D4: Impact on Assessment**

- **Weighting**:
    - 30% of Project Part 2 marks depend on peer/self-reviews.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **High Praise**: Member receives full 30% if peers confirm exceptional work.
    - **Negative Feedback**: Member’s score reduced if multiple peers report low contribution.
    - **Disputes**: Instructors mediate if a member contests evaluations.

---

### **D5: Best Practices**

- **Document Contributions**:
    - Use shared tools (e.g., Trello, Google Sheets) to track tasks.
    - Example:
        
        |Task|Assigned To|Status|
        |---|---|---|
        |Design `eoi` table|Member A|Complete|
        
- **Address Issues Early**:
    - Report inactive members to the tutor during the project, not just in final feedback.
- **Be Objective**:
    - Focus on actions, not personalities (e.g., "Missed deadlines" vs. "Lazy").

---

### **D6: Ethical Considerations**

- **Fairness**:
    - Avoid "revenge ratings" due to personal conflicts.
    - Base feedback on observable contributions.
- **Confidentiality**:
    - Do not share peer evaluations outside the Canvas system.

### **D7: Example Evaluation Form**

1. **Rate Member X’s technical skills**:  
    ☐ 1 (Poor) ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5 (Excellent)
2. **Describe Member X’s key contribution**:
    
    > "Refactored the PHP includes to reduce redundancy."
    
3. **Suggest one improvement for Member X**:
    
    > "Could participate more in weekly standups."

This structure ensures feedback is actionable, fair, and aligned with the project’s collaborative goals, fostering accountability and continuous improvement.
