 ### **Exercise 10: Identifying Bridging Questions from Your Core Sentence**
 
 - **Objective**: Transform your core sentence into targeted questions to trace familial trauma.
 - **Steps**:
     1. **Write Your Core Sentence**:
         - Example: _“I’ll never be good enough.”_
     2. **Deconstruct the Fear**:
         - Identify key themes (e.g., inadequacy, rejection, failure).
     3. **Formulate Bridging Questions**:
         - Ask:
             - _“Who in my family felt unworthy or rejected?”_
             - _“Who struggled with failure or shame?”_
             - _“Who was criticized or never felt ‘enough’?”_
     4. **Reflect on Answers**:
         - Journal about family stories, rumors, or patterns that arise.
 - **Example**:
     - _Core Sentence_: “I’ll be abandoned.”
     - _Bridging Questions_:
         - _“Who was left alone or orphaned?”_
         - _“Who lost a partner or child?”_

 ### **Exercise 11: Creating Your Genogram**
 
 - **Objective**: Map generational traumas to identify links between your struggles and family history.
 - **Steps**:
     1. **Draw the Structure**:
         - Use symbols (□ = male, ○ = female) for three generations (self, parents, grandparents).
     2. **Add Key Details**:
         - Birth/death dates, marriages, divorces, estrangements.
     3. **Note Traumas**:
         - Label each person with significant hardships:
             - Early deaths, suicides, abandonments, illnesses, wars, crimes.
             - Include miscarriages, adoptions, or secrets (e.g., “Grandpa’s first wife died in childbirth”).
     4. **Analyze Patterns**:
         - Look for:
             - **Repetitive ages** (e.g., multiple deaths at age 40).
             - **Recurring themes** (e.g., financial ruin, addiction).
             - **Silences** (relatives no one discusses).
     5. **Link to Core Sentence**:
         - Write your core sentence at the top. Ask:
             - _“Whose story does this fear belong to?”_
 - **Example**:
     - _Core Sentence_: “I’ll end up alone.”
     - _Genogram Insight_: A grandfather who was widowed young and lived in isolation.

 ### **Therapeutic Goals of the Exercises**
 
 - **Self-Reflection to Systemic Awareness**: Shift from _“What’s wrong with me?”_ to _“What happened to us?”_
 - **Externalization**: Separate personal identity from inherited trauma (e.g., “My anxiety isn’t mine—it’s my grandmother’s”).
 - **Narrative Repair**: Fill gaps in family history to create a coherent life story.

 ### **Tips for Effective Engagement**
 
 - **Start Small**: Focus on one parent’s side if overwhelmed.
 - **Use Metaphors**: If facts are missing, follow emotional clues (e.g., “Mom always seemed haunted”).
 - **Seek Family Input**: Ask elders for stories, but respect boundaries if they’re reluctant.
 - **Embrace Uncertainty**: Partial answers still provide insight (e.g., “Dad’s sister died young, but he won’t say how”).

 ### **Case Study Application**
 
 - **Carole’s Genogram Exercise**:
     - Revealed her grandmother’s traumatic childbirths → Explained her fear of “betrayal” by her body.
 - **Zach’s Bridging Questions**:
     - _“Who avoided punishment?”_ → Led to his grandfather’s unconfessed war crimes.
