- **Coping Mechanisms**
    - **How Children Cope with Emotional Loneliness**: 
	    - Children who experience emotional loneliness will do whatever is necessary to make some kind of connection with their parents. 
	    - They may learn to put other people's needs first as the price of admission to a relationship. 
	    - Instead of expecting others to provide support or show interest in them, they may take on the role of helping others, convincing everyone that they have few emotional needs of their own. 
	    - This can create even more loneliness, as covering up their deepest needs prevents genuine connection with others.
    - **Impact on Adult Relationships**:
	    - Lacking adequate parental support or connection, many emotionally deprived children are eager to leave childhood behind. 
	    - They become competent beyond their years but lonely at their core. 
	    - They often jump into adulthood prematurely, getting jobs, becoming sexually active, marrying early, or joining the service.
	    - In their rush to leave home, they may end up in relationships that replicate their early emotional loneliness, tolerating exploitation or staying in unfulfilling jobs.
	    - Emotional loneliness feels normal to them, like their early home life.
