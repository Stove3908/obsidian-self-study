[[8.4. Alternative Methods to Discover Core Sentence]]

## **3. Fine-Tuning the Core Sentence**  
_(Expanded Details)_

- **Process**:
    
    - **Optician metaphor**: Like adjusting lens strength, test slight wording shifts (e.g., “They reject me” vs. “I’m unlovable”) to find the “sharpest” emotional focus.
    - **Pronoun experimentation**: Switch between _I_, _They_, _My_, or _It_ to identify the most resonant perspective (e.g., “My family disappears” vs. “I lose my family”).
- **Deepening Techniques**:
    
    - **Iterative questioning**: Ask, _“And what’s the worst part of that?”_ repeatedly to excavate layers:
        - Example:
            - Layer 1: “I’ll fail.”
            - Layer 2: “They’ll laugh at me.”
            - Layer 3: “I’ll never belong anywhere.”
    - **Temporal shifts**: Test past/present/future tenses (e.g., “They left me” vs. “They’ll leave me”) to pinpoint unresolved trauma timelines.
- **Body as Guide**:
    
    - **Physical markers**: A “ping” sensation (e.g., chest tightness, chills) signals alignment; a “thud” (flatness, numbness) suggests inaccuracy.
    - **Voice feedback**: Speaking the sentence aloud—shaking or tears may indicate authenticity.
- **Examples from Text**:
    
    - **Mary**: Core sentence evolved from “I feel invisible” to “I’ll always be alone” after linking to her unnamed stillborn brother.
    - **Zach**: Shifted from “I need to die” to “I must be punished” to mirror his grandfather’s unconfessed WWII guilt.
- **Common Adjustments**:
    
    - **From vague to specific**: “I’ll lose everything” → “My children will suffer.”
    - **From passive to active**: “I’m abandoned” → “They abandon me.”
- **Dynamic Nature**:
    
    - The core sentence may evolve as family trauma is uncovered (e.g., a client initially fearing “I’ll go crazy” later reframing to “They’ll lock me up” after discovering an institutionalized ancestor).
- **Key Insight**:
    
    - A well-tuned core sentence feels _inescapably true_—a “north star” guiding the healing journey.
