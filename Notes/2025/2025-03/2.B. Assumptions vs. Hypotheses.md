# Assumptions vs. Hypotheses
- **Assumptions (The Negative Side):**
    - **Blind You:** Assumptions "muck up our perceptual windows."
    - **Based on Bias:** Using what they've heard or their own biases.
    - **Pre-Meeting Judgments:** Making assumptions about others even before meeting them.
    - **Ignoring Perceptions:** Ignoring own perceptions to conform to conclusions.
    - **Unchanging View:** Showing an unchanging, often flawed, version of the situation.
    - **Result:** Less emotionally open, less intellectually agile.
- **Hypotheses (The Positive Side):**
    - **Guide You:** Good negotiators are ready for surprises. Great negotiators _use skills to reveal_ surprises.
    - **Multiple Hypotheses:** Holding multiple hypotheses in mind simultaneously.
        - About the situation
        - About the counterpart's wants
        - About a range of variables
    - **Present and Alert:** Being present and alert in the moment.
    - **Testing and Winnowing:** Using new information to test hypotheses.
        - Discarding false ones
        - Keeping true ones
    - **Mindset of Discovery:** Engaging the process with a mindset of discovery.
    - **Goal:** Extract and observe as much information as possible.
    - **Questioning Accepted Beliefs:** Questioning assumptions accepted on faith or arrogance.
    - **Result:** More emotionally open, more intellectually agile to a fluid situation.
- **The Smart People Problem:**
    - Smart people _can_ have trouble negotiating.
    - They think they don't have anything to discover.
