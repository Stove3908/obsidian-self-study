- [[It Didn't Start With You]]
- **Negative Legacy of Inherited Trauma**
	
	- _Cyclical Suffering_:
		- Unexplained mental health issues (e.g., Gretchen’s depression) perpetuated across generations.
		- **Silence as a Vector**: Unspoken traumas (e.g., Colin’s death) breed shame and isolation.
	- _Physical Manifestations_:
		- Chronic pain, autoimmune disorders linked to prolonged stress (Yehuda’s cortisol research).
		- Example: Low cortisol in Holocaust descendants increasing PTSD susceptibility.
- **Positive Adaptations & Resilience**
	
	- _Epigenetic Strengths_:
		- Enhanced crisis response (Yehuda: "Who would you rather be in a war zone?").
		- Inherited survival strategies (e.g., hypervigilance repurposed as situational awareness).
	- _Ancestral Resilience_:
		- **Post-Traumatic Growth**: Transforming pain into purpose (e.g., Gretchen advocating for Holocaust education).
		- Strengthened family bonds through shared healing (e.g., Jesse’s family memorializing Colin).
- **Healing Outcomes**
	
	- _Individual Liberation_:
		- Symptoms reframed as “messages” from the past (e.g., Jesse’s insomnia = a call to honor Colin).
		- Reclaiming agency: "This pain is not mine to carry."
	- _Generational Impact_:
		- Breaking cycles (e.g., Gretchen’s future children spared inherited Holocaust trauma).
		- Legacy of resilience: Stories of survival passed down as strengths (vs. secrets).
- **Therapeutic Importance of Family History**
	
	- _Preventive Care_:
		- Early intervention by identifying at-risk families (e.g., descendants of war, genocide, systemic oppression).
	- _Holistic Diagnosis_:
		- Contextualizing symptoms within a generational framework (e.g., insomnia ≠ personal failure but ancestral echo).
	- _Cultural Relevance_:
		- Honoring communal trauma (e.g., Indigenous, Black, or refugee communities rebuilding through ancestral wisdom).
