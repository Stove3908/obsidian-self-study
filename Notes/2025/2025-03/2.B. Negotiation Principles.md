# Negotiation Principles




### Core Philosophy
- Negotiation as a process of discovery, not confrontation
- Goal is to uncover information rather than "win" arguments
- Emphasis on emotional intelligence and psychological tactics
- Adapting approach based on new information

### Key Concepts
- **Active Listening**: Fundamental to all successful negotiations
- **Slowing Down**: Creating space for thoughtful responses
- **Voice Tone**: Strategic use of different vocal approaches
- **Mirroring**: Technique for building rapport and extracting information
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Viewing assumptions as testable theories

### Strategic Approaches
- **Discovery Mindset**: Being curious rather than confrontational
- **Safety Creation**: Making counterparts feel secure enough to talk
- **Emotional Awareness**: Recognizing and responding to emotional cues
- **Information Gathering**: Prioritizing learning over persuading initially
- **Rapport Building**: Establishing connection before problem-solving

### Application in the Bank Robbery
- Negotiators initially rushed, then adjusted pace
- Used mirroring to extract information from Chris Watts
- Applied different voice tones to different situations
- Tested hypotheses about number of perpetrators
- Created safety for Bobby Goodwin to surrender

### Contrast with Traditional Methods
- Different from command-and-control approaches
- More emphasis on psychological aspects
- Less focus on "winning" and more on mutual resolution
- Acknowledges emotional dimensions of negotiation

### Implementation Steps
1. Prepare with multiple hypotheses
2. Enter with discovery mindset
3. Use appropriate voice tone for situation
4. Practice active listening
5. Apply mirroring technique when needed
6. Continuously test and refine assumptions

- Rushing to solutions
- Ignoring emotional dimensions
- Using confrontational approaches

### Long-term Impact
