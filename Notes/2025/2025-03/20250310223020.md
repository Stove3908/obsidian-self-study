# Operators

## Definition
- Symbols that perform specific operations on variables and values (operands).
- Used to manipulate data, perform calculations, and make comparisons.

## Categories
- **Arithmetic Operators:** ^47c8b0dd-68ee-7e2c
	- `+` (Addition)
		- **Explanation:** Adds two operands.
		- **Example:** `int sum = a + b;`
	- `-` (Subtraction)
		- **Explanation:** Subtracts the second operand from the first.
		- **Example:** `int difference = a - b;`
	- `*` (Multiplication)
		- **Explanation:** Multiplies two operands.
		- **Example:** `int product = a * b;`
	- `/` (Division)
		- **Explanation:** Divides the first operand by the second.
		- **Example:** `float quotient = (float)a / b;` (explicit cast to float to avoid truncation)
		- üìù**Note:** Integer division truncates the decimal part.
	- `%` (Modulo)
		- **Explanation:** Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.
		- **Example:** `int remainder = a % b;`
		- **Use Cases:** Determining even/odd numbers, wrapping values.
- **Assignment Operators:** ^8b207d5c-b13b-fb4d
	- `=` (Assignment)
		- **Explanation:** Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.
		- **Example:** `int x = 5;`
	- `+=` (Add and Assign)
		- **Explanation:** Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
		- **Example:** `x += 3;` (equivalent to `x = x + 3;`)
	- `-=` (Subtract and Assign)
		- **Explanation:** Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
		- **Example:** `x -= 2;` (equivalent to `x = x - 2;`)
	- `*=` (Multiply and Assign)
		- **Explanation:** Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
		- **Example:** `x *= 4;` (equivalent to `x = x * 4;`)
	- `/=` (Divide and Assign)
		- **Explanation:** Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
		- **Example:** `x /= 2;` (equivalent to `x = x / 2;`)
	- `++` (Increment)
		- **Explanation:** Increases the value of the operand by 1.
		- **Example:** `x++;` (equivalent to `x = x + 1;`)
		- **Prefix vs. Postfix:** `++x` (prefix) increments before the value is used; `x++` (postfix) increments after the value is used.
	- `--` (Decrement)
		- **Explanation:** Decreases the value of the operand by 1.
		- **Example:** `x--;` (equivalent to `x = x - 1;`)
		- **Prefix vs. Postfix:** `--x` (prefix) decrements before the value is used; `x--` (postfix) decrements after the value is used.
	- `<=>` (Spaceship Operator - C++20)
		- **Explanation:** Performs a three-way comparison, returning a value indicating whether the left operand is less than, equal to, or greater than the right operand.
		- **Note:** Introduced in C++20, more advanced, will be explored later.
		- **Example:** `auto result = a <=> b;`
- Comparison (Relational) Operators (covered under Decisions, but mention here)
- Logical Operators (covered under Decisions, but mention here)

## **Expressions:**
- **Definition:** Combinations of variables, operators, and values that evaluate to a result.
- **Examples:**
	- `score = aliensShot + wavesCleared;`
	- `lives = lives - 1;`
	- `hitPoints = hitPoints / swordLevel;`
	- `answer = 10 * 10;`
- **Order of Operations:** Follows standard mathematical precedence (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

## **Compound Assignment Operators:**
- Technically, all assignment operators except `=`, `++`, and `--` are compound assignment operators.
- They combine an arithmetic operation with assignment.
