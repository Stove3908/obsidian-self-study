  Here are the detailed points for the seventh branch, **Gender and Emotional Loneliness**:

- **Gender and Emotional Loneliness**
    - **Emotional Loneliness in Men and Women**: 
	    - Emotional loneliness transcends gender, affecting both men and women. 
	    - Although women still outnumber men in seeking psychotherapy, many men also face the issue of feeling lonely in their primary relationships. 
	    - Cultural norms often suggest that males have fewer emotional needs, but this isn't true. 
	    - Men who lack emotional intimacy, a sense of belonging, or caring attention can feel as empty as anyone else, though they may resist showing it. 
	    - Emotional connection is a basic human need, regardless of gender.
    - **Story of Jake**:
	    - Jake had recently married Kayla, a bubbly woman who made him feel genuinely loved. 
	    - Despite being happy about his marriage, Jake couldn't shake a feeling of being very down in the dumps. 
	    - He felt like he was acting, forcing himself to be more upbeat than he really was. 
	    - Jake believed he needed to be a person who was super happy to make Kayla feel loved and keep her happy. 
	    - He was exhausted from trying to act happy and excited. When asked what he thought would happen if he honestly shared his feelings with Kayla, Jake feared she would be devastated and furious. This fear stemmed from his past experiences with his angry mother, who would blow up if people didn't do what she wanted. Jake's secure relationship with Kayla tempted him to relax and be himself, but he was sure that his relationship would suffer if he stopped trying so hard. Eventually, Jake understood his feelings and became more genuine with Kayla, who totally accepted him. He was surprised by the amount of anger he had toward his mother, realizing that hate is a normal reaction when someone tries to control you for no good reason.
