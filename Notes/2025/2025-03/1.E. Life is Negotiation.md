# 1.E. Life is Negotiation:

- **Ubiquity of Negotiation in Daily Life:**
    
    - Beyond Hostage Situations: Relevance to everyday interactions
    - Majority of Interactions: Negotiations at work and home
    - Simple, Animalistic Urge: "I want"
- **Examples of "I Want":**
    
    - "I want you to free the hostages."
    - "I want you to accept that $1 million contract."
    - "I want to pay $20,000 for that car."
    - "I want you to give me a 10 percent raise."
    - "I want you to go to sleep at 9 p.m."
- **Two Functions: Information Gathering & Behavior Influencing:**
    
    - Information Gathering: Uncovering the other party's needs, desires, and constraints
    - Behavior Influencing: Persuading the other party to move toward your desired outcome
- **Negotiation = Communication with Results:**
    
    - Getting What You Want: Achieving goals through interaction with others
    - Conflict Inevitable: Conflict is a natural part of relationships
    - Engaging in Conflict Constructively: Getting what you want without inflicting damage
- **Importance of Asking Correctly:**
    
    - Overcoming Aversion to Negotiation: Accepting negotiation as a part of how the world works
    - Negotiation is Not Browbeating: It's playing the emotional game of human society
    - Claiming Your Prerogative: Asking for what you think is right
    - Psychologically Aware Approach: Using emotions, instincts, and insights
    - Connecting Better with Others: Building rapport and understanding
    - Influencing Others: Persuading others to see your point of view
    - Achieving More: Getting what you want in a psychologically aware way
