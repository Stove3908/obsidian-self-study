- **Feeling Guilty for Being Unhappy**
    - **Struggles with Emotional Needs**: 
	    - People who function well and appear to have no problems often struggle with feelings of guilt for being unhappy. 
	    - They may feel that they should be happy because their physical needs were met in childhood, while their emotional needs remained unfulfilled.
	    - This confusion leads them to feel guilty for complaining and wanting more out of life. 
	    - They may list the things they have to be thankful for, as if their life were an addition problem whose positive sum means nothing can be wrong.
	    - However, they can't shake the feeling of being fundamentally alone and lacking the level of emotional intimacy they crave in their closest relationships.
    - **Story of Meaghan**: 
	    - Meaghan broke up with her boyfriend twice before getting pregnant in her first year of college. 
	    - Her parents pushed her to marry him, especially with a baby on the way, and Meaghan gave in.
	    - Years later, with three children in college, she was ready to end her marriage but felt confused and guilty about wanting to leave. 
	    - Meaghan's husband and parents couldn't understand why she wasn't satisfied, and they discounted her emotional complaints. 
	    - Meaghan felt embarrassed and guilty because her emotional needs outweighed her vows and commitments. 
	    - She realized that her family didn't want to hear her and that her emotional needs were valid. 
	    - Meaghan wanted to matter the most to someone and to be with someone who wanted to be with her, but she had been trained to think that her natural desire to feel special and loved was selfish.
