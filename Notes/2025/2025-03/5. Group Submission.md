[[6. Validation & Security]]

### **5.1: Group Submission**

- **Compressed File**:
    - **Name**: `groupName_part2.zip` (e.g., `AlphaSquad_part2.zip`).
    - **Contents**:
        - All PHP/HTML files (`index.php`, `manage.php`, `apply.php`, etc.).
        - Include files (`header.inc`, `settings.php`).
        - `images/`, `styles/`, and `styles/images/` directories with assets.
        - SQL scripts for table creation (e.g., `eoi.sql`, `jobs.sql`).
        - Presentation slides (PDF/PPTX).
    - **Structure**:
        
        ```
        project2/  
        ├── index.php  
        ├── styles/  
        │   └── style.css  
        ├── images/  
        │   └── logo.png  
        └── presentation_slides.pptx  
        ```
        
- **Mercury Deployment**:
    - Include the live Mercury URL in the Canvas submission comment (e.g., `https://mercury.swin.edu.au/project2`).
    - Validate that the site runs directly from `index.php` without manual fixes.

### **5.2: Individual Submission**

- **Presentation**:
    - **Delivery**: Each member presents their section in Week 12 (10–20 minutes total).
    - **Absence Policy**: Zero marks for non-attendance without approved special consideration.
- **Peer Evaluation**:
    - Submit the Canvas form under "Project Part 2 > Peer & Self Evaluation."
    - Criteria include:
        - Technical contribution (e.g., "Coded `manage.php` queries").
        - Timeliness (e.g., "Submitted tasks 2 days late").
        - Team collaboration (e.g., "Helped debug SQL errors").

---

### **5.3: Deadlines & Penalties**

- **Due Date**: 11 PM Monday, Week 12.
- **Late Penalties**:
    - 10% deduction per day (e.g., 20% off after 2 days).
    - Applies to both group and individual submissions.
- **Resubmissions**:
    - Allowed multiple times on Canvas; only the last submission is graded.

---

### **5.4: File Structure Compliance**

- **Validation Checklist**:
    - No absolute paths (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\project2\styles.css`).
    - Case-sensitive filenames (e.g., `Header.inc` ≠ `header.inc`).
    - All PHP includes functional on Mercury (test before submission).
- **Critical Files**:
    - `settings.php` must contain correct Feenix-MariaDB credentials.
    - `manage.php` must restrict unauthorized access (basic auth or enhancements).

---

### **5.5: Presentation Submission**

- **Slide Requirements**:
    - Title slide with group name and member names/IDs.
    - Sections for each member’s role and technical contributions.
    - Screenshots of key features (e.g., `manage.php` interface).
    - ER diagram of the `eoi` and `jobs` tables.
- **Live Demo Tips**:
    - Test `process_eoi.php` form submission during rehearsal.
    - Prepare backup screenshots in case of Mercury downtime.

---

### **5.6: Common Pitfalls**

- **Broken Links**:
    - Test all hyperlinks and asset paths after unzipping the submission.
- **Incomplete Enhancements**:
    - If implementing login, ensure `managers` table and session logic are included.
- **Missing Files**:
    - Double-check for `styles/images/` backgrounds and SQL scripts.

---

### **5.7: Assessment Alignment**

- **Group Marks (70%)**:
    - **Functionality**: Forms, validation, database integration.
    - **Code Quality**: Readability, comments, security.
    - **Documentation**: `phpenhancements.php` clarity.
- **Individual Marks (30%)**:
    - **Presentation**: Clarity, technical depth, time management.
    - **Peer Reviews**: Fairness, specificity, professionalism.

---

### **5.8: Post-Submission Steps**

1. **Verify Mercury Deployment**:
    - Test all pages logged in as a guest and HR manager (if enhancements include auth).
2. **Download & Test ZIP**:
    - Ensure unzipped files retain the `project2/` structure.
3. **Confirm Canvas Submission**:
    - Check timestamp and Mercury link in submission comments.

This expansion ensures students adhere to technical, procedural, and collaborative requirements, minimizing risks of mark deductions.
