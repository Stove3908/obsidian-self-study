## 1. The Problem with "Parent as Enforcer":
- **a. Jonah's Story:**
	- Hating Homework:
		- Boredom with assignments
		- Feeling overwhelmed
		- Lack of interest in the subject matter
	- Parents' Hectoring/Oversight:
		- Constant questioning about homework
		- Checking for errors
		- Setting strict schedules
		- Hovering while he "works"
	- Common Refrains ("One shot at college," "You'll thank us," etc.):
		- "You're wasting your potential."
		- "This is for your own good."
		- "We just want you to be successful."
		- "Don't you care about your future?"
	- Jonah's Resistance (Pretending, not doing homework):
		- Devising elaborate excuses
		- Procrastination
		- Arguing with parents
		- Passive-aggressive behavior (e.g., "forgetting" assignments)
		- Actively refusing to do the work
	- The Underlying Issue:
		- Jonah felt his parents didn't trust him.
		- He felt a lack of control over his own life.
		- His identity was being suppressed.
- **b. Why It Doesn't Work:**
	- Erodes Internal Motivation:
		- Turns learning into a chore
		- Child only acts to please parents, not for personal satisfaction
		- Decreases intrinsic interest in subjects
	- Requires Constant Pushing:
		- Creates a cycle of dependence on external pressure
		- Parents become exhausted and resentful
		- Child never learns self-discipline
	- Kids Don't Learn Responsibility:
		- They see homework as someone else's problem
		- They don't develop time management skills
		- They avoid accountability for their actions
	- Creates Resentment:
		- Damages the parent-child relationship
		- Leads to power struggles and conflict
		- Undermines trust and communication
- **c. Homework Wars:**
	- War Metaphors:
		- "Battleground"
		- "Constant conflict"
		- "Dreading the evening"
	- Enforcing Rules Parents Don't Believe In:
		- Memorizing irrelevant facts
		- Completing busywork assignments
		- Focusing on grades over learning
	- Parents Working Harder Than Kids:
		- Nagging, reminding, and threatening
		- Doing the work for the child
		- Arranging tutors and interventions
	- Inability to Force Compliance:
		- Physical force is not an option
		- Threats and punishments are ineffective long-term
		- Child can always resist passively
	- Serenity Prayer & Coda (You can't make them...):
		- Acceptance of what you can't control
		- Focus on what you _can_ influence (your own actions)
		- The 4 points:
			- 1. You can’t make your kids do something against their will.
			- 2. You can’t make your kids want something they don’t want.
			- 3. You can’t make your kids not want what they want.
			- 4. It’s okay, at least right now, for them to want what they want and not want what they don’t want.
