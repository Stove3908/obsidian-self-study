# Negotiation Principles



---

### **Mirroring**

- **Mechanics**:
    - Repeat 1–3 critical words (e.g., Chris Watts: “We need a van” → Negotiator: “A van?”).
    - Forces counterpart to elaborate (Watts admitted getaway driver fled).
- **Why It Works**:
    - **Isopraxism**: Humans bond through mimicry (e.g., Bobby Goodwin dropped his muffled voice after negotiator mirrored calmly).
    - Study: Waiters mirroring orders earned **70% higher tips**.
- **Tactical Use**:
    - **Student Example**: Boss demanded “two copies” → Student mirrored, leading to digital compromise.
    - **Avoid Overuse**: FBI initially botched mirroring by asking, “Are you Chris Watts?” too aggressively.

### **Voice Tones**

- **Late-Night FM DJ Voice**
    
    - _Usage_: Downward inflection, slow pace (e.g., “Joe’s gone. You’re talking to me now”).
    - _Impact_: Projected control during Chris Watts’ switch to negotiator Chris Voss.
    - _Science_: Low, steady tones signal safety (triggering parasympathetic nervous system).
- **Positive/Playful Voice**
    
    - _Default Mode_: Light, encouraging, smile-infused (e.g., “Absolutely! Let’s figure this out”).
    - _Example_: Instructor’s girlfriend haggled in Istanbul markets with playful banter.
    - _Effect_: Encourages collaboration (Bobby Goodwin: “I trust you, Joe”).
- **Direct/Assertive Voice**
    
    - _Risks_: Triggers defensiveness (e.g., “Open the vault now!”).
    - _Exception_: Rarely used for non-negotiable terms (e.g., “We don’t do work-for-hire”).

### **Active Listening**

- **Team Analysis**:
    - FBI/NYPD teams assigned roles: One tracked mood, another analyzed “tells” (e.g., Watts’ false concern for hostages).
- **Silence as Tool**:
    - After mirroring, **4+ seconds of silence** pressured Bobby Goodwin to reveal his fear: “I don’t know how I’d do it.”
- **Mistakes to Avoid**:
    - _Interrupting_: Negotiator’s premature “Are you Chris Watts?” allowed denial.
    - _Selective Listening_: Early focus on “surrender” narrative delayed uncovering the escape plan.
- **Real-World Application**:
    - Student asked boss, “Where to store copies?” exposing lack of plan, leading to digital solution.

### **Tactical Empathy**

- **Labeling Emotions**:
    - Indirectly used when negotiator told Bobby, “Nobody’s gonna get hurt” (acknowledging fear).
- **Dynamic Silence**:
    - Pauses after mirrors gave Watts time to admit accomplice details (e.g., driver’s escape).

---

### **Connections to Outcomes**:

- Mirroring + DJ voice built enough trust for Bobby to surrender.
- Active listening exposed Watts’ lies about hostages’ well-being (e.g., “girls need to eat” vs. teller’s hidden basement escape).

### **Key Takeaway**:  
These techniques dismantle barriers by aligning with the counterpart’s psychology, transforming confrontation into collaboration.
