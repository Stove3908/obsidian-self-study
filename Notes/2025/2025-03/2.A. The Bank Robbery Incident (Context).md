    - Ringleader planted ruse to buy time
    - Command thought it would be a "cookie-cutter" situation, "in and out in ten minutes"
    - Believed there were 4 robbers
    - Robbers wanted a van to drive themselves and hostages to the local precinct
- **FBI/NYPD Response:**
    - Chris Voss and Charlie Beaudoin raced to the scene
    - Joint Terrorism Task Force experience (Holland/Lincoln Tunnel bomb plot)
    - Command Post set up across the street in another bank
    - SWAT team on rooftops with rifles trained on the bank
- **Complications/Reality:**
    - Situation went "sideways" almost immediately
    - Everything assumed was wrong
    - "Lead" hostage-taker running a "counterintelligence operation" (misinformation)
    - Only one other robber (plus getaway driver)
    - Co-conspirators were also hostages (thought they were burglarizing an ATM)
    - Getaway driver fled the scene early on
