# 1.D. The FBI Gets Emotional
- **Limitations of "Getting to Yes" in Crisis Situations:**
    
    - Problem-Solving Skills: FBI gained experience in problem-solving during the 1980s and 90s
    - Crucial Ingredient Missing: The system lacked a crucial ingredient
    - Irrationality of Hostage-Takers: "Getting to Yes" didn't work with kidnappers or individuals in crisis
    - Breakdown Between Theory and Experience: The book's theory didn't translate to real-world law enforcement
- **Ruby Ridge & Waco:**
    
    - Fatally Disastrous Sieges: Highlighted the failures of existing techniques
    - Randy Weaver's Ruby Ridge (1992)
    - David Koresh's Branch Davidian Compound in Waco, Texas (1993)
- **CIRG Formation:**
    
    - U.S. Deputy Attorney General Philip B. Heymann: Questioned the effectiveness of hostage negotiation techniques
    - "Lessons of Waco" Report: Summarized the inability to handle complex hostage situations
    - FBI Director Louis Freeh (1994): Announced the formation of the Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG)
    - Blended Division: Combined Crisis Negotiation, Crisis Management, Behavioral Sciences, and Hostage Rescue teams
- **Shift to Psychological Skills & Crisis Intervention:**
    
    - Oakland, California Hostage Negotiation Class: Led by Fred Lanceley and Gary Noesner
    - Emphasis on Emotional Incidents: Emotionally driven incidents, not rational bargaining, were the bulk of police negotiators' work
    - Laser-Focus on the Emotional: Negotiating skills had to focus on the animal, emotional, and irrational aspects of human behavior
    - Education in Psychological Skills: Crisis intervention situations required psychological skills
- **Tactical Empathy (Listening as a Martial Art):**
    
    - Simple Psychological Tactics: Calming people down, establishing rapport, gaining trust, eliciting needs, persuading with empathy
    - Change the Behavior: Shift the emotional environment of the crisis
    - Universally Applicable Premise: People want to be understood and accepted
    - Listening Intensely: Demonstrates empathy and a desire to understand
    - Psychotherapy Research: Feeling listened to leads to self-reflection, less defensiveness, and willingness to listen to other views
    - Balancing Emotional Intelligence and Influence: Gaining access to the mind of another person
    - Active Listening: Not a passive activity, but the most active thing you can do
- **New Techniques:**
    
    - Experimentation with Therapeutic Techniques: Counseling skills aimed at developing positive relationships through understanding
    - Negotiation World Split: Rational problem-solving vs. psychology, counseling, and crisis intervention
    - Ivy League vs. FBI: Math and economics vs. empathy
