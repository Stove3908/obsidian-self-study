# The Problem with Traditional Negotiation (and Thinking)

- **Selective Listening:**
    - Hearing only what you want to hear.
- **Cognitive Bias:**
    - Consistency rather than truth.
- **Limited Processing Capacity:**
    - Miller's "Magical Number Seven": We can only process about 7 pieces of information at a time.
    - Easily overwhelmed.
- **Negotiation as Battle:**
    - Viewing negotiation as a battle of arguments.
    - Overwhelmed by voices in their own head.
    - Thinking about arguments when not talking.
    - Making arguments when talking.
- **State of Schizophrenia:**
    - Everyone just listening to the voice in their head.
    - Multiple "people" talking at once (internal voices).
