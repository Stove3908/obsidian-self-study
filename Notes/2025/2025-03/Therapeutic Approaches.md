- **Uncovering Family History**
	
	- _Method_:
		- **Three-Generation Exploration**: Mapping traumas in client’s parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents (e.g., Gretchen’s grandmother’s Holocaust history).
		- **Clue-Based Inquiry**: Identifying keywords (e.g., "vaporize," "cold"), ages (Jesse at 19), and symptoms (insomnia) as entry points.
	- _Purpose_:
		- Contextualize symptoms as inherited vs. personal (e.g., Jesse’s fear tied to his uncle’s death).
		- Break isolation: "This isn’t my pain—it’s my family’s."
	- _Example_: Asking, "Did anyone in your family die young, go to war, or experience a major loss?"
- **Somatic Techniques**
	
	- _Embodiment Exercises_:
		- **Footprints Exercise**: Physically standing in ancestors’ "shoes" (e.g., Gretchen embodying her grandmother’s Holocaust grief).
		- **Sensations as Messengers**: Encouraging clients to describe bodily feelings (e.g., Jesse’s shivering as a link to hypothermia).
	- _Process_:
		- Reassociating fragmented sensations with their origins (e.g., Gretchen’s chest tightness = grandmother’s survivor guilt).
		- **Grounding Practices**: Breathing exercises to anchor clients in the present post-reactivation.
	- _Outcome_: Release of "stuck" trauma (e.g., Gretchen’s softened body posture after the exercise).
- **Integration of Awareness & Experience**
	
	- _Steps_:
		- **Intellectual Insight**: Explaining generational trauma (e.g., Jesse learning about epigenetic cortisol transmission).
		- **Visceral Release**: Using art, movement, or dialogue to externalize trauma (e.g., Jesse writing a letter to his uncle).
	- _Tools_:
		- **Narrative Reconstruction**: Rewriting family stories (e.g., "Colin died bravely" vs. "Colin’s death was meaningless").
		- **Rituals**: Symbolic acts (lighting candles, memorializing) to honor ancestors and close trauma loops.
- **Post-Discovery Healing**
	
	- _Client Empowerment_:
		- Redefining identity beyond inherited trauma (e.g., Gretchen: "I’m not broken—I’ve been carrying a legacy").
		- Building resilience through ancestral strengths (e.g., Jesse’s uncle’s perseverance).
	- _Long-Term Strategies_:
		- Family dialogues to break silence (e.g., Jesse’s parents discussing Colin’s death openly).
		- Mindfulness to detect and redirect inherited triggers (e.g., Gretchen’s "pause and breathe" technique for suicidal urges).
