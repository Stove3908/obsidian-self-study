- Traumatic events often recalled in disjointed pieces of images, sounds, sensations, words,... (**fragmented memories**) rather than as a complete narrative.

- Ability to organize thoughts impaired 
	- → difficult to connect fragmented memories to original event 
	- → hinders the ability to describe or fully remember what happened

- **Speechless Terror**: During a traumatic event, the brain’s speech center and medial prefrontal cortex can shut down, leaving individuals unable to articulate their experience, as noted by Bessel van der Kolk.        
    - Impaired Memory: The brain struggles to form coherent memories, resulting in fragmented or incomplete recall.

- This difficulty in verbalizing trauma underscores why alternative therapies (like art or body-based approaches) can be vital for recovery.
    
- Example: A survivor of a flood might recall the sound of rushing water or a sense of dread but be unable to narrate the event step-by-step.
- The fragments stored in unconscious mind, can resurface when triggered by reminders of trauma, influencing behavior without conscious awareness.
-  This explains why trauma survivors may feel confused about their memories/ react strongly to seemingly unrelated triggers in their daily lives.

- Example: Someone in a car accident might feel panic when hearing a loud noise like a horn, even if they don’t consciously link it to the past event.
