- Traumatic events often recalled in disjointed pieces of images, sounds, sensations, words,... (**fragmented memories**) rather than as a complete narrative.
- Ability to organize thoughts impaired → difficult to connect fragmented memories to original event.
- The fragments stored in unconscious mind, can resurface when triggered by reminders of trauma, influencing behavior without conscious awareness.

-  This explains why trauma survivors may feel confused about their memories/ react strongly to seemingly unrelated triggers in their daily lives.

- Example: Someone in a car accident might feel panic when hearing a loud noise like a horn, even if they don’t consciously link it to the past event.
