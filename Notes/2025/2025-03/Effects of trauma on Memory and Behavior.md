- Trauma significantly alters how memories are stored and how behaviors emerge:
    - **Memory Fragmentation**: Traumatic events are often recalled in disjointed pieces—such as images, sounds, sensations, or words—rather than as a complete narrative.
    - **Disrupted Thought Processes**: The ability to organize thoughts is impaired, making it difficult to connect fragmented memories to the original event.
    - **Unconscious Reenactment**: These fragments are stored in the unconscious mind and can resurface when triggered by reminders of the trauma, influencing behavior without conscious awareness.

- fragment memories
