- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$​)**:
    - $\mu_D = 0$ (no population mean difference).
    - Verbal: _"No difference between conditions."_
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$​)**:
    - Non-directional: $μ_D\neq0$ (two-tailed test).
    - Directional: $\mu_D>0$ or $\mu_D<0$ (one-tailed test).
    - Example: _"Memory training increases license plate recall ($\mu_D>0$)."
