## 4. Adolescent Vulnerability ^5669b3e5-ecee-f631
- **A. Brain Development:**
	- Significant brain development occurs between ages 12 and 18 (more than any time except the first few years of life).
	- Important new pathways and connections are made.
	- Prefrontal cortex (judgment) doesn't mature until around age 25.
	- Emotional control functions mature around age 32.
	- Stress can interfere with prefrontal cortex development.
- **B. Exaggerated Stress Responses:**
	- Adolescents have exaggerated stress responses compared to children or adults.
	- Amygdala is more reactive to frightening faces (study by B.J. Casey).
	- Higher stress response when speaking publicly.
- **C. Less Stress Tolerance:**
	- Adolescent brains take longer to bounce back from stress (about three weeks vs. ten days for adults).
	- More likely to develop stress-related illnesses (colds, headaches, upset stomachs).
- **D. Anxiety and THP Steroid:**
	- THP (a steroid that usually calms nerve cells and lowers anxiety) has less effect in adolescents.
	- Adolescents have more vulnerability to stress and fewer tools to deal with it.
	- Anxiety builds on itself with little hope of relief.
- **E. Depression "Scars" the Brain:**
	- Depression can leave "scars" in the brain, making individuals more vulnerable to subsequent episodes.
	- Less and less stress is required to trigger a subsequent episode.
	- Depression can develop with no environmental stressor.
	- Adults who experienced major depression in adolescence are likely to display long-term problems in work, relationships, and pleasure in life.
	- Even after recovery, teens may have mild but persistent symptoms (pessimism, sleep/appetite issues) that make them more vulnerable to depression later in life.
- **F. Example: Jared's Story:**
	- As a child, Jared was good-humored and resilient ("Teflon Kid").
	- As a teen, he became depressed and took antidepressants.
	- High stress about school and being tired "pushed him over the edge."
	- He felt he had to stay up late to do homework to compete with other students.
	- He will forever be more vulnerable to depressive episodes.
	- Being too tired and too stressed for too long is a formula for anxiety and depression.
