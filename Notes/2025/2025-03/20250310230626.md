## 4. How the Brain Responds:
- a. **Kids Need Responsibility to Develop:**
	- Brain development is experience-dependent.
	- Responsibility fosters growth in areas like decision-making and self-regulation.
	- Withholding responsibility hinders the development of these crucial skills.
- b. **Brain Develops How It's Used:**
	- Neural pathways strengthen with repeated use.
	- Giving children opportunities to make choices strengthens the neural pathways associated with decision-making.
	- Over-controlling parenting can weaken these pathways.
- c. **Opportunity to Make Decisions:**
	- Even small decisions (clothing, room decor) activate the prefrontal cortex.
	- These small experiences build confidence and competence.
	- They prepare the child for larger, more complex decisions later in life.
- d. **Strengthens Prefrontal Cortex (Pilot):**
	- The prefrontal cortex is responsible for executive functions (planning, impulse control, working memory).
	- A strong prefrontal cortex helps children manage stress and make good choices.
	- The "Pilot" (prefrontal cortex) gains power, rather than being overridden by the "Lion Fighter" (amygdala/emotional response).
- e. **Four Stages of Competency:**
	- **Unconsciously Incompetent:**
		- Doesn't realize they lack a skill or knowledge.
		- "I'm fine, I don't need to study."
		- Consultant role is difficult here - resist the urge to intervene too much.
	- **Consciously Incompetent:**
		- Realizes they lack a skill or knowledge.
		- "Okay, I need to study math."
		- Awareness is the first step to improvement.
	- **Consciously Competent:**
		- Can perform the skill with effort and focus.
		- "I've studied hard, I know my math."
		- Requires deliberate practice and attention.
	- **Unconsciously Competent:**
		- Can perform the skill automatically and effortlessly.
		- "Math is like breathing to me."
		- Skill has become ingrained and requires little conscious thought.
- f. **Importance of Allowing Failure as a Learning Experience:**
	- Failure provides valuable feedback.
	- It helps children identify their weaknesses and areas for improvement.
	- It builds resilience and coping skills.
	- Parents should support and guide, but not prevent failure.
	- Reframing failure as a temporary setback, not a catastrophe.
