## **1. Introduction to Databases**  
   - **Definitions**  
     - **Database**: Organized collection of structured information, accessible quickly by computer programs.  
     - **Relational Database**: Stores data in **tables** (e.g., `employee_info` table with columns like `emp_id`, `last_name`).  
     - **Table**: A structured set of data organized into rows (records) and columns (fields).  
     - **Record**: A single row in a table, representing a complete set of related data (e.g., one employeeâ€™s details).  
     - **Field**: A column in a table, defining a specific category of data (e.g., `address`, `suburb`, `pcode`).  

   - **Keys**  
     - **Primary Key**: Unique identifier for each record in a table (e.g., `emp_id` in the `employee_info` table).  
       - Ensures data integrity and speeds up queries.  
     - **Foreign Key**: Field in a related table that references the primary key of another table (e.g., `emp_id` in the `payroll` table links to `employee_info`).  
       - Establishes relationships between tables.  

   - **Relationships**  
     - **One-to-One**:  
       - One record in Table A links to **exactly one** record in Table B.  
       - Example: `employee_info` (primary) and `payroll` (related), where each employee has one payroll entry.  
       - Purpose: Isolate sensitive data (e.g., payroll details).  
     - **One-to-Many**:  
       - One record in Table A links to **multiple** records in Table B.  
       - Example: An employee (`employee_info`) can have multiple entries in the `language_skills` table (e.g., Java, C#, etc.).  
       - Reduces redundancy by splitting data into logical sets.  
     - **Many-to-Many**:  
       - Requires a **junction/associative table** (e.g., `emp_language_junction`).  
       - Example: Multiple employees can know multiple programming languages.  
       - Junction table contains foreign keys from both related tables (e.g., `emp_id` and `language_id`).  

   - **Normalization**  
     - Process of structuring a database to:  
       1. Eliminate redundant data (e.g., storing language skills in a separate table instead of repeating in `employee_info`).  
       2. Ensure data dependencies make sense.  
     - Benefits: Improved efficiency, easier maintenance, and reduced storage costs.  

## **Examples from Lecture**  
### **Employee Table**:  

| emp_id | last_name | first_name | address             | suburb     |
| ------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| 101    | Coffey    | Billy      | 648 Riversdale Road | Camberwell |

### **Payroll Table (One-to-One):**

|emp_id|start_date|pay_rate|health_cover|
|---|---|---|---|
|101|2005|31.50|none|

### **Language Skills Table (One-to-Many):**

|emp_id|language|years|
|---|---|---|
|101|Java|5|
|101|C|7|
