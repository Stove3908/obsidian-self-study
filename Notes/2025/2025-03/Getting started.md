This section will guide you towards two paths for running the workshop.

- If you are participating in an AWS organized event, your instructor will provide you with access to an AWS account provisioned exclusively for this workshop and the application and infrastructure already running.
    
- The second path is running the workshop in your own AWS account, where you will incur charges for as long as the resources are deployed until deleted.
    

This section will guide you through these alternate paths, and setup all the pre-requisites.
