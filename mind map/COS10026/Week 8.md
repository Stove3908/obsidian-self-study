# Lecture 8. PHP Includes and Managing State

## PHP Includes and Managing State Mind Map

### 1. PHP Includes
   - **Purpose**: Code reuse at file level
     - Facilitates reusing PHP code across multiple files
     - Useful for including recurring functionality or content (e.g., menus, headers, footers)
     - Helps maintain consistency across web pages
     - Reduces code duplication and maintenance effort

   - **include_once vs require**
     - include_once: Includes and evaluates a specified file during execution
       - If the file is already included, it won't be included again
       - Produces a warning but doesn't stop script execution if file is missing
     - require: Same as include but produces a fatal error if file is missing
       - Script execution stops immediately if file isn't found
       - Use when the included file is essential for the script to run

   - **Examples of usage**
     - Including HTML templates
     - Reusing PHP functions
     - Sharing configuration settings
     - Creating modular code structure

   - **File naming conventions**
     - Common extensions: .html, .php, .inc
     - Best practices:
       - Use descriptive names
       - Indicate the purpose of the file
       - Consider using a consistent naming convention
       - Separate reusable components into logical files

   - **Considerations**
     - File path resolution
     - Security implications of including files
     - Performance impact of excessive includes
     - Scope of variables within included files



### 2. Managing State between Client and Server
   - **Understanding State Information**
     - HTTP was designed to be stateless
     - Web browsers don't store persistent data about visits by default
     - Need to maintain state for various web applications
     - State information must be passed between client and server

   - **Reasons for Maintaining State**
     - Multi-page form navigation
     - User preferences customization
     - Shopping cart functionality
     - User authentication and sessions
     - Visit tracking and analytics
     - Bookmarking capabilities

   - **Techniques for Maintaining State**
     1. **Hidden Form Fields**
        - Store data in form fields that aren't visible to users
        - Use `<input type="hidden">` in HTML forms
        - Data is sent to server when form is submitted
        - Example: Passing calculation results between pages
        - Considerations: Data is visible in page source, not secure for sensitive information

     2. **Query Strings**
        - Append name-value pairs to URLs
        - Format: `url?name1=value1&name2=value2`
        - Automatically used with GET method forms
        - Example: Passing user information between pages
        - Considerations: Data is visible in URL, length limitations, security concerns

     3. **Sessions**
        - Server-side storage of state information
        - Unique session ID identifies each user's session
        - Started with `session_start()`
        - Data stored in `$_SESSION` superglobal
        - Example: User authentication and personalized content
        - Considerations: Session management, security, timeout settings

   - **Comparison of Techniques**
     - Visibility: Hidden fields and query strings are client-side visible; sessions are server-side
     - Security: Sessions generally more secure for sensitive data
     - Persistence: Sessions can maintain state across multiple page requests
     - Implementation Complexity: Sessions require more setup than hidden fields or query strings

   - **Best Practices**
     - Use sessions for sensitive or important state information
     - Combine techniques when appropriate
     - Consider security implications of each method
     - Validate and sanitize all incoming state information
     - Handle session expiration and cleanup appropriately
