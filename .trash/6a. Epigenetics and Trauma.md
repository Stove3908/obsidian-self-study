## Content

Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression (the way genes are turned on or off) that do not involve changes to the DNA sequence itself. Traumatic experiences can lead to epigenetic modifications that can be passed down to future generations, influencing their susceptibility to stress, mental health, and other traits.
