## Content:
- Unconscious reenactment is a central mechanism in inherited trauma. 
- Descendants may unconsciously repeat patterns, behaviors, or relationship dynamics mirroring ancestral trauma. 
- This can involve experiencing unexplained emotions, fears, or physical symptoms linked to the original trauma, or making life choices that echo unresolved ancestral conflicts.
