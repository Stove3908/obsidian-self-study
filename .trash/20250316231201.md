**Mindmap: STA10003 Lecture 8 â€“ Paired Samples t-test & Applications**

### **1. Paired Samples t-Test**

- **Definition**:
    - Tests differences between two related conditions (dependent samples).
    - Focuses on **difference scores** (e.g., pre-test vs. post-test).
- **Research Designs**:
    - **Repeated Measures**: Same participants measured twice (e.g., before/after intervention).
    - **Matched Pairs**: Participants matched on key variables (e.g., age, gender).
- **Hypotheses**:
    - $H_{0}$: $\mu_D = 0$ (no population mean difference).
    - H1:Î¼Dâ‰ 0H_1: \mu_D \neq 0H1â€‹:Î¼Dâ€‹î€ =0 (significant population mean difference).
- **Assumptions**:
    1. **Independence**: Observations in each condition are independent.
    2. **Normality**: Difference scores are approximately normally distributed.
- **Example**:
    - Police officersâ€™ license plate recall before vs. after memory training.
    - Calculation steps: Mean difference (MDM_DMDâ€‹), standard deviation (sDs_DsDâ€‹), t-statistic, confidence interval.

### **2. SPSS Output & Report Writing**

- **SPSS Steps**:
    - Compute difference scores (`Transform > Compute Variable`).
    - Run **Analyze > Compare Means > Paired-Samples T Test**.
- **Interpreting Output**:
    - **Descriptives**: MMM, SDSDSD, and SESESE for both conditions and difference scores.
    - **Paired Samples Test**: t-value, df, p-value, 95% CI for mean difference.
- **Report Structure**:
    1. **Introduction**: State hypothesis (e.g., "Memory training improves recall").
    2. **Sample Findings**: Report means, SDs, and difference scores.
    3. **Results**: t(df)=value, p=value, 95% CI [lower, upper].
    4. **Conclusion**: Link results to hypothesis (e.g., "Training significantly increased recall").
- **Examples**:
    - Boysâ€™ self-estimated vs. actual height (non-significant).
    - Girlsâ€™ self-reported vs. actual height (significant).
    - Happiness when living with family vs. alone (significant).

### **3. Assignment Part 2**

- **Requirements**:
    - Use a **random sample** from SPSS data.
    - Answer 4 questions:
        1. **One-sample t-test** (Week 6).
        2. **Independent samples t-test** (Week 7).
        3. **Paired samples t-test** (Week 8).
        4. **Short answer** (Week 5 concepts).
- **Key Tips**:
    - Check assumptions (e.g., normality, homogeneity of variance).
    - Use APA-style reporting for results.
    - Practice with **SPSS Tutorial Handout** for syntax guidance.
