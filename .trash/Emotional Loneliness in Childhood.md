- **Emotional Loneliness in Childhood**
    - **Experiences of Emotional Loneliness**: 
	    - Emotional loneliness in childhood is a profound and often invisible pain. 
	    - Children with emotionally immature parents may feel a gut-level sense of emptiness and isolation. 
	    - They lack the concept of emotional intimacy and may not understand their parents' emotional immaturity. 
	    - This loneliness can manifest as a feeling of being alone in the world, even when surrounded by family.
    - **Stories of David and Rhonda**:
        - **David's Story**:
	        - David described his childhood as incredibly lonely, feeling utterly isolated and emotionally disconnected from his family. 
	        - He felt like he was floating in the ocean with no one around him, a sensation of emptiness and nothingness that felt normal to him.
        - **Rhonda's Story**: 
	        - Rhonda remembered feeling totally alone during a family move, despite being physically present with her family. 
	        - She felt exhausted and anxious, unable to ask questions or share her feelings.
	        - This experience left her feeling that she had to cope with everything on her own.
