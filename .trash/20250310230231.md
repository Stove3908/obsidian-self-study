## 2. Understanding Stress ^64112fad-d0e7-b3e2
- **A. Types of Stress:**
	- **Positive Stress:**
		- Description: Motivates growth, risk-taking, high performance.
		- Characteristics: Jitters, excitement, anticipation (unless excessive).
		- Example: Preparing for a play.
		- Key Element: Sense of control over performance.
	- **Tolerable Stress:**
		- Description: Brief periods of stress that can build resilience.
		- Requirements: Supportive adults present, time to cope and recover.
		- Examples:
			- Parents arguing (but communicating with the child).
			- Being bullied (if not prolonged/repeated and with support).
			- Death in the family (with support).
		- Rat Study: Brief separation from mother leading to "California laid-back rats."
	- **Toxic Stress:**
		- Description: Frequent or prolonged activation of the stress system without support.
		- Characteristics: Severe (e.g., witnessing assault) or chronic (day in, day out).
		- Lack of supportive adults.
		- Perceived lack of control.
		- No reprieve.
		- Examples:
			- Adam (potentially experiencing toxic stress due to his environment).
			- Zara (potentially experiencing toxic stress due to pressure and lack of downtime).
		- Consequences: Damages ability to thrive, doesn't prepare for the real world.
		- Rat Study: Prolonged separation from mother leading to stressed pups who don't interact with their mothers.
- **B. Brain Systems Involved in Stress:**
	- **Executive Control System (The Pilot):**
		- Brain Region: Prefrontal Cortex
		- Functions: Planning, organization, impulse control, judgment.
		- Key Chemicals: Dopamine and Norepinephrine ("Goldilocks" - needs the right balance).
		- Effect of Stress: Easily taken offline by stress/sleep deprivation.
		- When Offline: Impulsive behavior, poor decisions.
	- **Stress Response System (The Lion Fighter):**
		- Brain Regions: Amygdala, Hypothalamus, Hippocampus, Pituitary and Adrenal Glands.
		- Amygdala: Primitive emotional processing center (fear, anger, anxiety).
		- Functions: Threat detection, triggers fight/flight/freeze response.
		- Effect of Stress: Amygdala takes over, behavior becomes defensive, reactive, inflexible.
		- Hormones: Adrenaline (quick spike), Cortisol (long-term battle).
		- Hippocampus Role: Turns off stress response, provides perspective.
		- Chronic Stress Effects: Enlarges amygdala, impairs hippocampus.
	- **Motivational System (The Cheerleader):**
		- Neurotransmitter: Dopamine
		- Functions: Reward, drive, motivation.
		- Effect of Stress: Dopamine levels decrease, leading to low drive and boredom.
	- **Resting State System (The Buddha):**
		- Brain Network: Default Mode Network (DMN)
		- Functions: Self-reflection, processing life, sorting past/future, creativity.
		- Activation: Daydreaming, meditation, unwinding.
		- Effect of Stress: Impairs DMN's ability to function.
		- Technology's Impact: Reduced opportunities for self-reflection.
