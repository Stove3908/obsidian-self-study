[[7.3. Interpreting Core Descriptors]]

## **2. Exercises to Identify Core Descriptors**

- **Written Exercise #3: Describing Your Mother**
    
    - **Instructions**:
        - Write unfiltered adjectives/phrases about your mother during your upbringing.
        - Examples: _“Cold,” “overprotective,” “never hugged me,” “sacrificed everything.”_
        - Include blame: _“I blame her for never listening to me.”_
    - **Rationale**:
        - Reveals early maternal bonds (or ruptures) shaping self-worth and trust.
        - Exposes projections (e.g., “She was never there” → fear of abandonment in relationships).
- **Written Exercise #4: Describing Your Father**
    
    - **Instructions**:
        - Describe your father’s traits and role in your childhood.
        - Examples: _“Critical,” “hardworking,” “absent,” “my hero.”_
        - Add blame: _“I blame him for never accepting me.”_
    - **Rationale**:
        - Uncovers paternal influences on ambition, authority, and self-criticism.
        - Highlights hidden loyalties (e.g., a “critical” father may lead to self-sabotage).
- **Written Exercise #5: Describing Partner/Friend/Boss**
    
    - **Instructions**:
        - Apply the same process to a significant person in your current life.
        - Examples: _“My partner is dismissive,” “My boss is controlling.”_
        - Note blame: _“I blame them for making me feel small.”_
    - **Rationale**:
        - Connects parental dynamics to present relationships (e.g., a “dismissive” partner mirrors a distant parent).
        - Identifies recurring patterns (e.g., authority figures triggering childhood fears).
- **Methodology**:
    
    - **Write, Don’t Think**: Avoid self-editing; prioritize raw, emotional honesty.
    - **Body Awareness**: Notice physical reactions (e.g., tension when describing a parent).
    - **Note**: Skip if biological parents are unknown (proceed to next chapter).
- **Why It Works**:
    
    - Bypasses rationalization to access primal emotions (e.g., grief under anger).
    - Creates a tangible record of unconscious biases for later analysis.
