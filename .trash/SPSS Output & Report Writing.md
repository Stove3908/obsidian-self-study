## SPSS Workflow

### Compute Difference Scores

#### Steps
`Transform > Compute Variable`.

Create a new variable (e.g., `DIFF = PostTest - PreTest`).

#### Purpose
Directly analyze the paired differences.

### Run Paired t-Test

#### Steps
`Analyze > Compare Means > Paired-Samples T Test`.

Select paired variables (e.g., `Before_Training` and `After_Training`).

#### Output Includes
Paired Samples Statistics: Means, SDs, and SE for both conditions.

Paired Samples Correlations: Relationship between paired scores (optional).

Paired Samples Test: Mean difference, t-value, p-value, 95% CI.
