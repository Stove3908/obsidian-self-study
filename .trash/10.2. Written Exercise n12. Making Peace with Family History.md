[[10.3. Healing Sentences & Rituals]]

## **2. Written Exercise #12: Making Peace with Family History**  
_A guided process to bridge core language with generational trauma and somatic release:_

---

### **Step 1: Identify Core Language**

- _Task_: Write down the core language (complaint, descriptors, sentence) with the **strongest emotional charge**.
- _Example_: “I’m suffocated by responsibility” → linked to a mother who raised siblings after her own mother’s death.
- _Why_: Pinpoints the “hook” where personal pain intersects with family history.

---

### **Step 2: Link to Traumatic Events**

- _Task_: Name the event(s) tied to the core language (e.g., war, abandonment, sudden death).
- _Key Questions_:
    - “Who suffered this first in my family?”
    - “What remained unspoken or unresolved?”
- _Example_: A client’s fear of “being trapped” tied to a grandfather’s imprisonment.

---

### **Step 3: List Affected Family Members**

- _Task_: Identify **direct and indirect** victims (e.g., silenced siblings, excluded relatives, blamed outsiders).
- _Focus_:
    - Who was **most impacted**?
    - Who is **forgotten or erased** (e.g., stillborn siblings, exiled relatives)?
- _Example_: A client realized their “fear of failure” mirrored an uncle’s shame after a business bankruptcy.

---

### **Step 4: Visualize the Trauma**

- _Task_: Imagine the event through the eyes of affected family members.
- _Guided Prompts_:
    - “What did they see, feel, or hear?”
    - “What couldn’t they express?”
- _Body Awareness_: Note sensations (e.g., heaviness, heat) as you visualize.
- _Example_: A client’s throat tightened while imagining their grandmother’s inability to grieve her son’s death.

---

### **Step 5: Connect to Bodily Sensations**

- _Task_: Locate where emotions manifest physically (e.g., chest, stomach).
- _Practice_:
    - Place a hand on the area.
    - Breathe into the sensation, allowing it to expand or release.
- _Example_: A client’s chronic shoulder pain eased after linking it to their father’s “carrying the weight” of family secrets.

---

### **Step 6: Breathwork & Affirmations**

- _Task_: Pair deep breathing with healing statements:
    - “I release what never belonged to me.”
    - “I honor your pain, but I choose peace.”
- _Science Note_: Activates the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing trauma’s physiological hold.

---

### **Step 7: Create Personal Healing Sentences**

- _Task_: Craft statements that:
    1. **Acknowledge** the family member’s struggle.
    2. **Release** the inherited burden.
    3. **Commit** to living fully.
- _Examples_:
    - “Grandma, your loneliness ends with me. I will connect deeply and joyfully.”
    - “Dad, I give back your shame. I choose to stand tall.”

---

## **Outcome**:

- **Somatic Release**: Clients often report trembling, crying, or warmth as trapped energy dissipates (e.g., Carole’s shaking in Ch. 9).
- **Shift in Identity**: Transforms “I am broken” to “I am freeing us both.”
- **Generational Dialogue**: Internalized family members “soften” as their pain is witnessed.
