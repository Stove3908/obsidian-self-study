- **Anxiety & Hypervigilance**:
    
    - _Panic Attacks_: Sudden, overwhelming fear (e.g., Jennifer’s subway episodes) mirroring childhood helplessness.
    - _Chronic Worry_: Anticipating abandonment (“They’ll leave me”) or failure (“I’ll lose control”).
- **Fear of Abandonment**:
    
    - _Relational Patterns_: Clinging to partners or preemptively rejecting them (Myrna’s avoidance of marriage).
    - _Existential Terror_: Fear of annihilation (“I won’t exist”) rooted in primal separation trauma.
- **Trust Deficits**:
    
    - _Interpersonal Distrust_: Difficulty relying on others, assuming betrayal (“They’ll hurt me”).
    - _Isolation_: Withdrawal to avoid vulnerability (e.g., Wanda’s lifelong aloneness).
- **Negative Self-Perception**:
    
    - _Internalized Beliefs_: “I’m not enough,” “I’m unlovable” from maternal emotional absence.
    - _Shame Cycles_: Self-blame for maternal detachment (“If I were better, she’d stay”).
- **Emotional Dysregulation**:
    
    - _Catastrophic Thinking_: Minor conflicts feel life-threatening (e.g., Myrna’s career fears).
    - _Numbing/Overwhelm_: Swinging between emotional shutdown and outbursts.
- **Relational Struggles**:
    
    - _Push-Pull Dynamics_: Oscillating between craving closeness and fearing engulfment.
    - _Repetition Compulsion_: Unconsciously recreating maternal abandonment in relationships.
- **Self-Sabotage**:
    
    - _Career Instability_: Undermining success due to fear of exposure or rejection.

- **Physical Manifestations**:
    
    - _Somatic Symptoms_: Hair-pulling (Kelly), digestive issues, or chronic fatigue tied to unresolved trauma.
    - _Hypersensitivity_: Overreacting to sensory stimuli (e.g., touch aversion from lack of maternal warmth).
- **Intergenerational Cycles**:
    
    - _Repetition of Trauma_: Unresolved maternal grief (e.g., Wanda’s mother) perpetuating emotional distance.
    - _Role Reversal_: Children parenting fragile mothers, normalizing caregiving over receiving.
- **Psychopathological Links**:
    
    - _Extreme Detachment_: Sociopathic tendencies (e.g., Magid’s “children without a conscience”) from severe early deprivation.
    - _Narcissistic Traits_: Compensatory grandiosity masking feelings of inadequacy.
- **Cognitive Distortions**:
    
    - _All-or-Nothing Thinking_: “Nobody will ever love me” after minor rejections.
    - _Mind Reading_: Assuming others’ disapproval without evidence.
