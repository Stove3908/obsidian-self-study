**1. Parent as Consultant Model**  
- **Definition**:  
  - Role akin to a business consultant: 
	  - Advise, support, and strategize without enforcing decisions.  
  - Contrasted with authoritarian (control-focused) and permissive (happiness-focused) parenting.  
  - Rooted in **authoritative parenting** (Baumrind, Steinberg, Levine): Balances warmth, clear boundaries, and respect for autonomy.  

- **Core Philosophy**:  
  - *"Their lives are their own"* (Eckhart Tolle): 
	  - Children are not extensions of parents but independent individuals.  
  - Focus on fostering **internal motivation** over external coercion.  
  - Long-term goal: Build self-reliance and accountability, not immediate compliance.  

- **Key Principles**:  
  1. **Guidance Over Control**:  
     - Ask questions to help children identify problems/solutions (e.g., *"What’s your plan for this?"*).  
     - Offer resources (tutors, study environments) without micromanaging.  
  2. **Ownership of Outcomes**:  
     - Shift responsibility to the child (e.g., Jonah’s parents: 
	     - *"We’re not willing to weaken you by making this our job"*).  
     - Allow natural consequences (e.g., failing a test due to poor preparation) as learning opportunities.  
  3. **Emotional Safety**:  
     - Home as a *"safe base"*: 
	     - Avoid battles that erode trust (e.g., homework wars).  
     - Prioritize relationship quality over task completion.  

- **Addressing Parental Fears**:  
  - *"But what if they fail?"*: 
	  - Failure is critical for developing resilience and problem-solving skills.  
  - *"They won’t reach their potential"*: 
	  - Potential is maximized through intrinsic drive, not parental pressure.  

- **Implementation Strategies**:  
  - **Consulting Hours**: 
	  - Designate time for support (e.g., 7–8 PM) but enforce boundaries (no late-night rescues).  
  - **Neutral Support Systems**:
	  - Use tutors/older peers to reduce power struggles.  
  - **Phrase Reframing**: 
	  - Replace *"Did you finish homework?"* with *"Do you need help planning?"*  

- **Research & Evidence**:  
  - Baumrind’s studies: 
	  - Authoritative parenting correlates with higher self-esteem, academic success, and emotional regulation.  
  - Neuroscience: 
	  - Autonomy strengthens prefrontal cortex development, enhancing decision-making and stress resilience.  

- **Case Study**:  
  - **Jonah’s Transformation**:  
    - Parents shifted from nagging to offering structured support (quiet study space, tutor access).  
    - Outcome: 
	    - Initial struggles → self-driven recovery (night school, college success).
