- **Independence**: ^c58c07
    - Observations in each condition are independent (no carryover effects).
- **Normality**:
    - Difference scores ($D$) are approximately normally distributed.
    - Check via histogram, Q-Q plot, or Shapiro-Wilk test (SPSS).
    - Robust for large samples ($>30$) despite skew.
