[[COS10026. Assignment 2 Overview]]
[[4. Review & Feedback]]

### **3.1: Introduction (Individual Contributions)**

- **Roles & Responsibilities**:
    - **Member 1 (Front-End Developer)**:
        - Designed HTML/CSS for `apply.php` and `jobs.php`.
        - Implemented client-side validation using HTML5 attributes.
    - **Member 2 (Back-End Developer)**:
        - Built PHP scripts (`process_eoi.php`, `manage.php`).
        - Integrated MySQL with mysqli for EOI/jobs tables.
    - **Member 3 (Database Architect)**:
        - Created schema for `eoi` and `jobs` tables.
        - Optimized queries for HR management features.
    - **Member 4 (Security & Enhancements)**:
        - Added login system for `manage.php`.
        - Implemented server-side validation and sanitization.
- **Project Objectives**:
    - Explain how your tasks align with the assignment goals (e.g., dynamic content, data integrity).

### **3.2: Development Process (Technology Focus)**

- **Front-End (HTML/CSS)**:
    - Demonstrated responsive design using Flexbox/Grid.
    - Example:
        
        ```html
        <!-- Responsive navigation in menu.inc -->  
        <nav class="flex-container">  
          <a href="index.php" class="flex-item">Home</a>  
          <a href="jobs.php" class="flex-item">Jobs</a>  
        </nav>  
        ```
        
- **PHP Scripting**:
    - Discussed server-side validation logic:
        
        ```php
        // Check job reference format  
        if (!preg_match("/^[A-Z0-9]{5}$/", $jobref)) {  
          header("Location: apply.php?error=invalid_jobref");  
          exit();  
        }  
        ```
        
- **Database Integration**:
    - Explained normalized table design to avoid redundancy.
    - Example query for HR interface:
        
        ```sql
        -- Retrieve EOIs for job reference 'SW123'  
        SELECT * FROM eoi WHERE JobReference = 'SW123';  
        ```
        
- **Security Enhancements**:
    - Demo hashed password storage:
        
        ```php
        $hashed_pwd = password_hash($_POST["password"], PASSWORD_DEFAULT);  
        ```

### **3.3: Database Interaction**

- **EOI Workflow**:
    - **Front-End to Back-End**: How form data from `apply.php` is sanitized and inserted into `eoi`.
    - **HR Management**: How `manage.php` uses `UPDATE`/`DELETE` queries.
- **Dynamic Job Listings**:
    - Demonstrated PHP loop to render jobs from the database:
        
        ```php
        $result = mysqli_query($conn, "SELECT * FROM jobs");  
        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {  
          echo "<div class='job'><h3>{$row['Title']}</h3></div>";  
        }  
        ```
        
- **Challenges & Solutions**:
    - **Postcode-State Validation**: Used regex arrays to match state rules.  
        **SQL Injection Prevention**: Utilized prepared statements:
        
        ```php
        $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, "INSERT INTO eoi (...) VALUES (?, ?, ...)");  
        mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "ssss...", $jobref, $firstname, ...);  
        ```

### **3.4: Conclusion (Individual Reflections)**

- **Key Learnings**:
    - **Member 1**: Mastered responsive design and form validation.
    - **Member 2**: Improved PHP/MySQL integration skills.
    - **Member 3**: Learned schema optimization for scalability.
    - **Member 4**: Explored security best practices (e.g., password hashing).
- **Collaboration Insights**:
    - Used Git for version control to merge code seamlessly.
    - Conducted peer code reviews to ensure quality.

---

### **3.5: Presentation Logistics**

- **Time Allocation**:
    - 3-5 minutes per member for a 4-person group.
    - Rehearse transitions between speakers.
- **Visual Aids**:
    - Slides with code snippets, ER diagrams, and screenshots.
    - Live demo of `manage.php` updating EOI status.
- **Submission Requirements**:
    - Upload slides to Canvas as part of group submission.
    - Ensure slides include team names and student IDs.

---

### **3.6: Common Pitfalls & Tips**

- **Avoid Overloading Slides**: Use bullet points, not paragraphs.
- **Technical Demo Prep**:
    - Test all features (e.g., form submission) on Mercury beforehand.
    - Have backup screenshots if live demo fails.
- **Q&A Preparation**:
    - Anticipate questions on validation logic or database design.
    - Assign topics to members (e.g., security, front-end).
