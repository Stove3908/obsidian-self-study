# Core Concepts

### **Assumptions vs. Hypotheses**

- **Dangers of Assumptions**:
    - Initial FBI/NYPD team believed robbers would surrender quickly (misinformation planted by Chris Watts).
    - Led to flawed strategy and public embarrassment when stalemate dragged on.
- **Hypothesis-Driven Approach**:
    - Treat assumptions as **testable guesses** (e.g., "Are there _really_ 5 robbers, or is Watts lying?").
    - Use new intel (e.g., "earwitness" identifying Watts’ voice) to discard false hypotheses.
- **Flexibility**:
    - NYPD commander’s early press briefing assumed hostage-takers were foreign nationals; later debunked.

### **Schizophrenia in Negotiation**

- **Internal vs. External Voices**:
    - Negotiators often focus on their own arguments (internal voice), missing critical cues (e.g., Watts’ inconsistent pronouns: “they” vs. “I”).
    - Example: FBI team initially missed that Watts was exaggerating the number of accomplices.
- **Cognitive Overload**:
    - George A. Miller’s “7±2 rule”: Brain can process ~7 pieces of info at once.
    - Solution: Use **teams** to analyze speech patterns, tone, and word choice (e.g., FBI team noted Watts’ calmness vs. his claim of fear).

### **Emotional Safety**

- **Needs vs. Wants**:
    - Wants = surface demands (e.g., “We need a van”).
    - Needs = survival-level concerns (e.g., Bobby Goodwin’s need to escape alive).
- **Validation**:
    - FBI used late-night DJ voice to make Watts/Goodwin feel heard (e.g., “Nobody’s gonna get hurt”).
    - Bobby’s trust in the negotiator’s calm tone led to his surrender.
- **Psychological Principle**:
    - People bond with those who mirror them (isopraxism).
    - Example: Oprah Winfrey’s interviewing style (rapport-building through empathy).

### **Connections to Techniques**:

- Testing hypotheses required **active listening** (e.g., spotting Watts’ lies about hostages’ care).
- Emotional safety enabled **mirroring** to work (e.g., Bobby’s unmuffled voice after trusting “Joe”).

### **Key Takeaway**:  
- Avoiding assumptions and fostering emotional safety allowed negotiators to uncover the truth (only 2 robbers) and resolve the crisis without bloodshed.
