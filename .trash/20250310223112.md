# Animating Sprites

## Overview
- Using variables, operators, and decisions to create the illusion of movement.
- Involves manipulating sprite properties (position, rotation, scale) over time.
- Key elements: loading sprites, setting initial conditions, updating sprite properties, and handling timing.

## Adding Sprites (Tree, Bee, Clouds) ^28a0158a-dcdc-8673
- **Creating `Texture` Objects:**
	- Purpose: To store image data on the GPU.
	- Code: `Texture textureName;`
- **Loading Images (`loadFromFile`):**
	- Purpose: To load an image from a file into the `Texture` object.
	- Code: `textureName.loadFromFile("graphics/image.png");`
- **Creating `Sprite` Objects:**
	- Purpose: To represent the image on the screen and allow for manipulation.
	- Code: `Sprite spriteName;`
- **Attaching Textures to Sprites (`setTexture`):**
	- Purpose: To associate the image data with the sprite.
	- Code: `spriteName.setTexture(textureName);`
- **Setting Sprite Positions (`setPosition`):**
	- Purpose: To place the sprite at a specific location on the screen.
	- Code: `spriteName.setPosition(x, y);`

## Random Numbers ^e4305d3b-3f58-54c1
- **Purpose:** To introduce variability and unpredictability into the animation.
- **`srand()` (Seed the Random Number Generator):**
	- Purpose: To initialize the random number generator with a seed value.
	- Code: `srand((int)time(0));`
	- **Importance:** Ensures different random sequences each time the program runs.
- **`time(0)` (Get Current Time for Seeding):**
	- Purpose: To provide a constantly changing seed value.
- **`rand() % range` (Generate Random Number Within a Range):**
	- Purpose: To generate a random number between 0 and `range - 1`.
	- Code: `int randomNumber = rand() % 100;` (generates a number between 0 and 99)
	- **Example:** `beeSpeed = (rand() % 200) + 200;` (generates a speed between 200 and 399)

## **Timing (Frame Rate Independence):** ^ef4828f8-4a3f-b6b2
- **Purpose:** To ensure consistent animation speed regardless of the frame rate.
- **`Clock` Class (SFML):**
	- Purpose: To measure elapsed time.
	- Code: `Clock clock;`
- **`clock.restart()` (Restart Clock and Get Elapsed Time):**
	- Purpose: To reset the clock and get the time since the last restart.
	- Code: `Time dt = clock.restart();`
- **`Time dt = clock.restart();` (Get Delta Time):**
	- Purpose: To store the elapsed time (delta time) between frames.
	- **`dt.asSeconds()`:** Converts the `Time` object to seconds (a `float` value).
- **Using Delta Time to Control Movement:**
	- Purpose: To scale the animation speed by the delta time.
	- Code: `sprite.setPosition(sprite.getPosition().x + (speed * dt.asSeconds()), sprite.getPosition().y);`
	- **Explanation:**
		- If the frame rate is high (small `dt`),
			- the sprite moves a small amount.
		- If the frame rate is low (large `dt`),
			- the sprite moves a larger amount, resulting in consistent speed.

## Moving the Bee and Clouds: ^11322868-f9c3-5afd
- **Using `if` to Check if the Bee/Cloud is Active:**
	- Purpose: To control when the sprite's properties are updated.
	- Code: `if (!beeActive) { ... }`
- **Setting Initial Random Position and Speed When Inactive:**
	- Purpose: To give each sprite a unique starting point and movement pattern.
	- Involves using `srand()`, `rand()`, and `setPosition()`.
- **Updating Position Based on Speed and Delta Time When Active:**
	- Purpose: To move the sprite across the screen.
	- Code:
		- `spriteBee.setPosition(`
			- `spriteBee.getPosition().x - (beeSpeed * dt.asSeconds()),`
			- `spriteBee.getPosition().y`
		- `);`
- **Recycling Sprites (Resetting When They Go Off-Screen):**
	- Purpose: To reuse sprites and create a continuous animation loop.
	- Involves checking if the sprite has moved off-screen and resetting its position and activity status.
	- Code:
		- `if (spriteBee.getPosition().x < -100) {`
			- `beeActive = false;`
		- `}`

## Key Variables ^1dc89c8f-b904-d716
- `beeActive`, `cloud1Active`, `cloud2Active`, `cloud3Active` (`bool`): Control whether the bee/clouds are currently moving.
- `beeSpeed`, `cloud1Speed`, `cloud2Speed`, `cloud3Speed` (`float`): Store the speed of each sprite.
- `dt` (`Time`): Stores the delta time (elapsed time between frames).
