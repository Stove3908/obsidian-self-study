## 1. The Problem: Lack of Control & Increased Stress ^bb17de53-7962-c4f5
- **Core Issue:** Diminished Sense of Control
	- **Definition:** Feeling unable to influence one's own life and outcomes.
- **Locus of Control Shift:**
	- **Lower Internal Locus of Control:** Belief that one's actions _don't_ determine outcomes.
		- **Evidence:** Studies show a decline in internal locus of control in students (1960-2002).
	- **Higher External Locus of Control:** Belief that external forces (fate, luck, others) control outcomes.
		- **Impact:** Associated with helplessness and ineffective stress management.
- **Mental Health Consequences:**
	- **Increased Anxiety & Depression:**
		- **Severity:** Adolescents/young adults 5-8 times more likely to experience anxiety symptoms.
		- **Comparison:** Higher than during the Great Depression, WWII, and the Cold War.
		- **Contributing Factors (from notes):** Culture valuing extrinsic goals (money, status) over community and meaning.
	- **Feelings of Powerlessness & Overwhelm:**
		- **Description:** A sense of being unable to cope with demands and challenges.
- **Behavioral Manifestations:**
	- **Passivity/Resignation:** Giving up, lack of engagement.
	- **Difficulty Managing Anger:**
	- **Self-Destructive Behaviors:** Actions that harm oneself.
	- **Self-Medication:** Using substances or behaviors to cope with emotional pain.
- **Impact on Development & Potential:**
	- **Failure to Thrive:** Despite resources and opportunities, children don't reach their potential.
	- **Inner Turmoil:** Regardless of background, lack of control takes a toll.
- **Root Cause Question:**
	- Are things actually harder now, or are we dampening natural coping mechanisms?
