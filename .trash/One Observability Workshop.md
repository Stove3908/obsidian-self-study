Welcome to the One Observability Workshop. This workshop provides you hands-on experience with a wide variety of tools AWS offers for monitoring and observability.

Whether your workload is on-prem or on AWS, or your application is a giant monolith or based on a modern microservice based architecture, our observability tools can help you get deeper insights into your application performance and health.

Our cost effective and native solutions provide powerful capabilities that enable you to identify bottlenecks, issues, and defects without you having to manually sift through various logs, metrics, and trace data.

Go ahead and play around with the workshop and please feel free to provide your feedback.
