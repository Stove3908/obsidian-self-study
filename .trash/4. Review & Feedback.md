[[COS10026. Assignment 2 Overview]]
[[5. Group Submission]]

### **4.1: Individual Task Requirements**

- **Peer Evaluation**:
    - Submit anonymous ratings for each team member via Canvas.
    - Criteria include:
        - **Contribution**: Quality and quantity of work (e.g., "Member X coded 80% of `process_eoi.php`").
        - **Communication**: Responsiveness in meetings and messaging platforms.
        - **Reliability**: Meeting deadlines (e.g., "Member Y submitted their tasks late twice").
        - **Collaboration**: Willingness to help others (e.g., "Member Z debugged SQL queries for the team").
    - Use a 5-point scale (1 = Poor, 5 = Excellent) or qualitative comments.
- **Self-Evaluation**:
    - Reflect on personal strengths (e.g., "I designed the database schema efficiently").
    - Identify areas for growth (e.g., "I could improve time management").

### **4.2: Constructive Feedback Guidelines**

- **Effective Feedback Examples**:
    - **Positive**:
        - "Member A’s validation logic in `process_eoi.php` ensured data integrity."
        - "Member B’s CSS made the site mobile-friendly."
    - **Constructive Criticism**:
        - "Member C could improve by documenting code for easier collaboration."
        - "Member D missed two meetings; better communication would help."
- **Avoid**:
    - Vague statements: "Member E did okay."
    - Personal attacks: "Member F is lazy."

---

### **4.3: Submission Process**

- **Canvas Form**:
    - Accessed via "Project Part 2" > "Peer & Self Evaluation."
    - Anonymous submission to protect privacy.
    - Deadline matches project submission (Week 12).
- **Post-Submission**:
    - Instructors compile feedback and share anonymized summaries.
    - Used to adjust individual marks if contribution discrepancies exist.

---

### **4.4: Impact on Assessment**

- **Weighting**:
    - 30% of Project Part 2 marks depend on peer/self-reviews.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **High Praise**: Member receives full 30% if peers confirm exceptional work.
    - **Negative Feedback**: Member’s score reduced if multiple peers report low contribution.
    - **Disputes**: Instructors mediate if a member contests evaluations.

---

### **4.5: Best Practices**

- **Document Contributions**:
    - Use shared tools (e.g., Trello, Google Sheets) to track tasks.
    - Example:
        
        |Task|Assigned To|Status|
        |---|---|---|
        |Design `eoi` table|Member A|Complete|
        
- **Address Issues Early**:
    - Report inactive members to the tutor during the project, not just in final feedback.
- **Be Objective**:
    - Focus on actions, not personalities (e.g., "Missed deadlines" vs. "Lazy").

---

### **4.6: Ethical Considerations**

- **Fairness**:
    - Avoid "revenge ratings" due to personal conflicts.
    - Base feedback on observable contributions.
- **Confidentiality**:
    - Do not share peer evaluations outside the Canvas system.

### **4.7: Example Evaluation Form**

1. **Rate Member X’s technical skills**:  
    ☐ 1 (Poor) ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5 (Excellent)
2. **Describe Member X’s key contribution**:
    
    > "Refactored the PHP includes to reduce redundancy."
    
3. **Suggest one improvement for Member X**:
    
    > "Could participate more in weekly standups."
