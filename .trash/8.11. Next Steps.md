[[It Didn't Start With You]]

**11. Next Steps**  
_(Expanded Details)_

- **Transition to Chapter 9**:
    
    - **Family Tree Construction**: Map a 3–4 generation genogram to trace:
        - **Traumatic Events**: Untimely deaths, suicides, wars, abandonments.
        - **Patterns**: Recurring causes of death, mental illness, relationship ruptures.
        - **Silences**: “Black sheep,” unmentioned pregnancies, censored stories.
- **Tools & Methods**:
    
    - **Genogram Symbols**: Use standardized icons (e.g., ⚪ for miscarriage, 🔺 for addiction).
    - **Oral Histories**: Interview elders with bridging questions (e.g., _“What happened to Grandma’s first husband?”_).
    - **Public Records**: Census data, death certificates, immigration logs to fill gaps.
- **Case Study Prep**:
    
    - **Zach’s Tree**: Revealed grandfather’s hidden WWII role → Explained Zach’s “need to die.”
    - **Linda’s Tree**: Uncovered great-aunt’s Holocaust murder → Contextualized kidnapping fear.
- **Linking to Core Sentence**:
    
    - **Example**: If your core sentence is _“I’ll lose everything,”_ flag ancestors who experienced bankruptcy, exile, or dispossession.
- **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - **Family Resistance**: Relatives refusing to discuss the past → Use phrases like, _“I’m trying to understand our family’s strengths.”_
    - **Incomplete Data**: Focus on patterns over specifics (e.g., “Many men died young” vs. exact causes).
- **Action Items**:
    
    1. **Draft a Genogram**: Start with known relatives + rumored traumas.
    2. **Highlight Resonant Events**: Circle those that “ping” with your core sentence.
    3. **Note Emotional Legacies**: E.g., _“Grandpa’s alcoholism → Dad’s rigidity → My perfectionism.”_
- **Key Insight**:
    
    - _“A family tree is a map of love and loss. Follow the scars to find your way home.”_

This expansion prepares readers to systematically link their core sentence to ancestral patterns, setting the stage for Chapter 9’s deep dive into genealogical healing.
