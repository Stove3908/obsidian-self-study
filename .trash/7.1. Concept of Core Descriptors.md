[[7.2. Exercises to Identify Core Descriptors]]

## **1. Concept of Core Descriptors**

- **Definition**:
    
    - Spontaneous adjectives or phrases that unconsciously describe parents (or close relationships).
    - Formed from childhood images stored as _feeling states_ in the body.
    - Reflect unresolved emotions and hidden loyalties (e.g., adopting or rejecting parental behaviors).
- **Purpose**:
    
    - Act as a **doorway** to the unconscious themes from Chapter 5.
    - Reveal how childhood dynamics shape current relationships, self-perception, and life patterns.
    - Highlight incomplete or distorted inner images of parents (e.g., "She never gave me enough").
- **Key Insights**:
    
    - Words "half reveal and half conceal the Soul within" (Tennyson): Core descriptors mask deeper truths.
    - Childhood experiences act as "recorders," storing parental interactions as emotional imprints.
    - Unresolved descriptors create a **life blueprint** (e.g., "I don’t receive enough" mirrors a disconnected mother).
    - Writing bypasses rationalization, exposing raw, unfiltered emotions.
    - Negative descriptors often hide grief, while positive ones reflect trust in life.
- **Why They Matter**:
    
    - Uncover hidden generational patterns (e.g., repeating a parent’s suffering).
    - Expose projections onto others (e.g., blaming a partner for a parent’s traits).
    - Serve as a starting point for healing fractured bonds (e.g., rebuilding trust with a "cold" mother).
