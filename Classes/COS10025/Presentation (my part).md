## **Solar-Powered IoT Water System Diagram**  
### _Flowchart Components:_

1. **Input**: Saline water from coastal/groundwater sources.
2. **Solar Still Basin**: Modular HDPE structure purifies water via solar evaporation/condensation.
3. **Storage**: Clean water stored for domestic/agricultural use.
4. **Smart Irrigation**: IoT sensors (soil moisture, water quality) feed data to ESP32 microcontroller.
5. **Cloud Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring via Firebase; SMS alerts via Twilio.

**

- Saline water from coastal, groundwater, or surface sources is first pumped into the solar still basin where it is desalinated into potable water. 
- The purified water then flows into a storage unit and is simultaneously used for irrigation. 
- IoT sensors continuously monitor water quality and soil moisture; this data is sent to the ESP32-C3 microcontroller, which adjusts water levels and issues commands to valve actuators accordingly.
- Simultaneously, the sensor data is transmitted via the gateway to the cloud for trend analysis and future predictions.
- In cases of potential water shortages, SMS alerts and emails (with links to detailed usage charts on the dashboard) are sent. 
- For system malfunctions, technicians are alerted, while residents provide feedback through the online interface to eventually refine predictive algorithms.

## **Slide 2: Three Approaches in Design Stages**

1. **Analyze** (Monitoring):
    - Measure water quality (pH, salinity) and soil moisture.
2. **Reduce** (Desalination):
    - Solar energy converts saline water to potable water.
3. **Prevent** (Optimization):
    - Smart irrigation prevents water waste and crop damage.

## **Slide 3: Technologies per Approach**

1. **Analyze**:
    - _R-SAM-PRO Sensor_: Monitors water quality (40% cost reduction)(Satyam, 2024).
    - _Capacitive Soil Sensor_: Durable, low-power moisture detection (Adla et al., 2020).
2. **Reduce**:
    - _HDPE Solar Still Basin_: Corrosion-resistant, modular design.
    - _Canadian Solar 400W Panels_: High efficiency, 25-year lifespan (Canadian Solar, 2024).
3. **Prevent**:
    - _Orbit B-hyve Controller_: Adjusts irrigation in real time.
    - _Dorot Valves_: Precise flow control via ESP32 commands.
