###### **Slide 1: Design Idea – Solar-Powered IoT Water Purification and Distribution System**  
- **Core Concept**:  
	- Integrates solar desalination, IoT sensors, and smart irrigation to address water scarcity in Ninh Thuan, Vietnam.  
- **Key Components**:  
	- **Solar Desalination**: Modular HDPE basin + Canadian Solar panels.  
	- **IoT Sensors**: R-SAM-PRO (water quality) + capacitive soil sensors.  
	- **Smart Distribution**: Orbit B-hyve controller + valve actuators.  
	- **User Interface**: Cloud dashboard (Firebase) + SMS/email alerts (Twilio API).  
- **Figure 4**: Diagram shows saline water input → solar desalination → IoT-monitored storage → smart irrigation.



###### **Slide 2: Three Design Approaches & Technologies**  
- **Analyze**: _Monitoring & Data Collection_  
	- **R-SAM-PRO Sensor**: Tracks pH, salinity, temperature (WHO compliance).  
	- **Capacitive Soil Sensor**: Measures moisture for irrigation scheduling.  
- **Reduce**: _Solar Desalination & Energy Efficiency_  
	- **HDPE Solar Still Basin**: Low-cost, corrosion-resistant evaporation/condensation.  
	- **Canadian Solar 400W Panels**: High efficiency + 25-year lifespan.  
- **Prevent**: _Smart Water Management_  
	- **Orbit B-hyve Controller**: Adjusts irrigation via real-time soil data.  
	- **Dorot Valve Actuators**: Regulate flow rates to prevent overuse.



###### **Slide 3: Benefits, Impacts, & Constraints**  
- **Benefits**:  
	- **Dual Use**: Potable water for households + optimized irrigation for farms.  
	- **Cost Savings**: Solar energy + 30–50% reduced water waste.  
	- **Predictive Alerts**: Early shortage detection via IoT-cloud analytics.  
- **Impacts**:  
	- **Health**: Reduces waterborne diseases.  
	- **Economy**: Boosts agriculture + saves time for education/income activities.  
	- **Sustainability**: Trains locals in solar/IoT tech for long-term resilience.  
- **Constraints**:  
	- **Initial Cost**: ~171M VND (offset by 10-year lifespan + low operational costs).  
	- **Training**: Requires community upskilling for maintenance.  
	- **Financing**: Reliance on grants/loans for scalability.
