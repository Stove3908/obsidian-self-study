## **Solar-Powered IoT Water System Diagram**  
### _Flowchart Components:_

1. **Input**: Saline water from coastal/groundwater sources.
2. **Solar Still Basin**: Modular HDPE structure purifies water via solar evaporation/condensation.
3. **Storage**: Clean water stored for domestic/agricultural use.
4. **Smart Irrigation**: IoT sensors (soil moisture, water quality) feed data to ESP32 microcontroller.
5. **Cloud Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring via Firebase; SMS alerts via Twilio.

## **Slide 2: Three Approaches in Design Stages**

1. **Analyze** (Monitoring):
    - Measure water quality (pH, salinity) and soil moisture.
2. **Reduce** (Desalination):
    - Solar energy converts saline water to potable water.
3. **Prevent** (Optimization):
    - Smart irrigation prevents water waste and crop damage.

## **Slide 3: Technologies per Approach**

1. **Analyze**:
    - _R-SAM-PRO Sensor_: Monitors water quality (40% cost reduction)(Satyam, 2024).
    - _Capacitive Soil Sensor_: Durable, low-power moisture detection (Adla et al., 2020).
2. **Reduce**:
    - _HDPE Solar Still Basin_: Corrosion-resistant, modular design.
    - _Canadian Solar 400W Panels_: High efficiency, 25-year lifespan (Canadian Solar, 2024).
3. **Prevent**:
    - _Orbit B-hyve Controller_: Adjusts irrigation in real time.
    - _Dorot Valves_: Precise flow control via ESP32 commands.

## **Slide 4: Benefits, Impacts, & Constraints**  
### **Benefits**:

- Clean water access.
- 30â€“50% less water waste via smart irrigation (Dukes et al., 2010; EPA WaterSense, 2024).  
### **Impacts**:
- Reduces waterborne diseases; saves time for education/economic activities.
- Trains locals in solar/IoT tech; boosts agriculture.  
### **Constraints**:
- High upfront cost (~171M VND); requires grants/funding.
- Training needed for system maintenance and data interpretation.

## **Slide 5: Conclusion**  
### **Scalable Sustainability**:

- Combines solar desalination, IoT, and local materials for coastal regions.
- Long-term affordability via solar energy and reduced waste.  
### **Call to Action**:
- Pilot in Ninh Thuan, then expand across Vietnam.
- Engage communities through training and participatory design.
