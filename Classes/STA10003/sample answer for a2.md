# 1 sample t test

A university lecturer hypothesised that the average amount of sleep per night for students taking her unit differs from 8 hours per night. 

For a random sample of 15 university students taking her unit, the average amount of sleep per night was 7.20 hours (s = 0.86 hours).  This is lower than 8 hours per night and a one-sample t-test shows this difference in mean hours sleep per night is significant, t(14) =3.60, p = .003 

The 95% confidence interval shows that average hours sleep per night for university students taking the instructor’s unit is between 0.32 and 1.28 hours less than 8 hours. 

As expected, the average amount of sleep per night for students taking the instructor’s unit differs from 8 hours, with her students on average sleeping less than 8 hours per night.

# independent sample test

Health researchers hypothesised that the average BMI of Australian men is higher than that of Australian women.

For a random sample of 1716 Australian adults, the average BMI of the men (M = 28.21 kg/m2, s = 5.16 kg/m2, n = 871) was higher than the average BMI of the women (M = 26.12 kg/m2, s = 4.97 kg/m2, n = 845) and an independent samples t-test shows this difference in mean BMI is significant, t(1714) = 8.55, p < .001 

The 95% confidence interval shows that average BMI of Australian men is between 1.61 and 2.57 kg/m2 higher than for Australian women. 

As expected, the average BMI of Australian men is higher than that of Australian women
