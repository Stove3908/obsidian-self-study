Research conducted in 2010 suggested that the average food expenditure in Australia was $125.00 per week.  An economist has predicted that average expenditure on food per week has now changed.

An economist hypothesised that current average expenditure on food per week in Australia differs from the average food expenditure in 2010, which was $125.00 per week. 

For a random sample of 196 Australian adults, the average amount of food expenditure per week was $116.42 ~~per week~~ (s = $54.42 ~~per week~~).  This is lower than $125 per week and a one-sample t-test shows this difference in ~~mean hours sleep per night~~ is significant, t(195) = 29.95, p < 0.001 

The 95% confidence interval shows that current average amount of food expenditure per week for Australian adults is between $0.91 and $16.25 per week less than $125.00 per week in 2010. 

As expected, the current average expenditure on food per week in Australia differs from the research conducted in 2010, which was $125 per week

The economist also suggested that Australian adults who play sport will spend 
more money per week on leisure activities than those who do not play sport

An economist hypothesised that the average weekly expenditure on leisure activities of Australian adults who play sport is higher than those who do not play sport.

For a random sample of 177 Australian adults, the average expenditure per week on leisure activities of Australian adults who play sport (M = $100.80, s = <span style="background:rgba(205, 244, 105, 0.55)"> $ </span>31.85, n = 64) was higher than the average weekly expenditure on leisure activities of  those who do not play sport (M = <span style="background:rgba(205, 244, 105, 0.55)"> $ </span>91.53, s = <span style="background:rgba(205, 244, 105, 0.55)"> $ </span>36.09, n = 113), and an independent samples t-test shows this difference in mean leisure expenditure per week is not significant, t(175) = 1.71~~1~~, p = 0.89 

The 95% confidence interval shows that the average expenditure per week on leisure activities of Australian adults who play sport is between $1.42 less and $19.96 more  than for those who do not play sport. 

There is no evidence to suggest any difference in the weekly expenditure on leisure activities of Australian adults who play sport and those who do not play sport.

Researchers predicted that the level of conflict in relationships for Australian adults is lower than it was in 2020. Previous research indicated that for Australian adults the average level of conflict in relationships in 2020 was 90. The level of conflict in relationships is measured on a scale from 0 to 200, with higher values indicating a higher level of conflict in relationships. Conduct a one-sample t-test to test this prediction. Produce the relevant SPSS output, and write a one-sample t-test report based on your output. Include the relevant output after your report. 

 

A study was conducted to investigate if weekly food expenditure in Australia is now different to what it was in 2010 [$125.00]. 

In a random sample of 196 Australian adults, the average expenditure on food per week was $116.42 (s = $54.42). This is, in fact, lower than the average weekly food expenditure recorded in 2010 ($125.00), and a one-sample t-test shows that this difference in mean food expenditure per week is significant, t(195) = 2.21, p = .028. The 95% confidence interval indicates that the average weekly food expenditure is between $0.91 and $16.25 less per week than it was in 2010. 

As expected weekly food expenditure in Australia is now different than it was in 2010. Australian adults, on average, now have lower weekly food expenditure than in 2010.

Researchers predicted that the level of happiness in relationships reported by Australian adults is lower for males than for females. The level of happiness in relationships is measured on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating a higher level of happiness in relationships. Conduct an independent samples t- test to test this prediction. Produce the relevant SPSS output, and write an independent samples t-test report based on your output. Include the relevant output after your report. 

An economist predicted that Australian adults who play sport spend more money per week on leisure activities than those who do not play sport. 

In a random sample of 177 Australian adults, the average leisure expenditure for people who play sport (M = $100.80, s = $31.85, n = 64) was higher than the average leisure expenditure per week for those who do not play sport (M = $91.53, s = $36.09, n = 113), however an independent samples t-test shows that this difference in mean weekly leisure expenditure is not significant, t(175) = 1.71, p =.089. The 95% confidence interval indicates that the mean weekly leisure expenditure of Australian adults who play sport is between $1.42 per week lower and $19.96 per week higher than for those who do not play sport. 

There is insufficient evidence to suggest that that Australian adults who play sport spend more money per week on leisure activities than those who do not play sport.

It was predicted that Australian adults would spend a different amount of money on food per week than they do on leisure activities. 

In a random sample of 177 Australian adults, on average, the expenditure on food per week (M = $117.19, s = $54.89) was higher than the expenditure on leisure activities (M = $94.88, s = $34.81). A paired samples t-test shows that this difference in the mean 
amount spent per week ( MD = $22.31, SD = $62.14) is significant, t(176) = 4.78, p < .001. 
The 95% confidence interval indicates that the mean amount spent on food per week is 
between $13.10 and $31.53 higher than the amount spent on leisure activities. 

As expected, Australian adults do spend a different amount of money on food and leisure 
activities, with them spending more on food per week than on leisure activities.
