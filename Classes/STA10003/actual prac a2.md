Research conducted in 2010 suggested that the average food expenditure in Australia was $125.00 per week.  An economist has predicted that average expenditure on food per week has now changed.

An economist hypothesised that current average expenditure on food per week in Australia differs from the average food expenditure in 2010, which was $125.00 per week. 

For a random sample of 196 Australian adults, the average amount of food expenditure per week was $116.42 ~~per week~~ (s = $54.42 ~~per week~~).  This is lower than $125 per week and a one-sample t-test shows this difference in ~~mean hours sleep per night~~ is significant, t(195) = 29.95, p < 0.001 

The 95% confidence interval shows that current average amount of food expenditure per week for Australian adults is between $0.91 and $16.25 per week less than $125.00 per week in 2010. 

As expected, the current average expenditure on food per week in Australia differs from the research conducted in 2010, which was $125 per week

The economist also suggested that Australian adults who play sport will spend 
more money per week on leisure activities than those who do not play sport

An economist hypothesised that the average weekly expenditure on leisure activities of Australian adults who play sport is higher than those who do not play sport.

For a random sample of 177 Australian adults, the average expenditure per week on leisure activities of Australian adults who play sport (M = $100.80, s = 31.85, n = 64) was higher than the average weekly expenditure on leisure activities of  those who do not play sport (M = 91.53, s = 36.09, n = 113), and an independent samples t-test shows this difference in mean leisure expenditure per week is not significant, t(175) = 1.711, p = 0.89 

The 95% confidence interval shows that the average expenditure per week on leisure activities of Australian adults who play sport is between $1.42 less and $2.57 more  than for those who do not play sport.
