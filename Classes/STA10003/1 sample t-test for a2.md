1  t sample 

A university lecturer hypothesised that the average amount of sleep per night for students taking her unit differs from 8 hours per night. 

For a random sample of 15 university students taking her unit, the average amount of sleep per night was 7.20 hours (s = 0.86 hours).  This is lower than 8 hours per night and a one-sample t-test shows this difference in mean hours sleep per night is significant, t(14) =3.60, p = .003 

The 95% confidence interval shows that average hours sleep per night for university students taking the instructor’s unit is between 0.32 and 1.28 hours less than 8 hours. 

As expected, the average amount of sleep per night for students taking the instructor’s unit differs from 8 hours, with her students on average sleeping less than 8 hours per night.
