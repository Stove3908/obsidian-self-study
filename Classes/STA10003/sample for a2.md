1  t sample 

A university lecturer hypothesised that the average amount of sleep per night for students taking her unit differs from 8 hours per night. 

For a random sample of 15 university students taking her unit, the average amount of sleep per night was 7.20 hours (s = 0.86 hours).  This is lower than 8 hours per night and a one-sample t-test shows this difference in mean hours sleep per night is significant, t(14) =3.60, p = .003
