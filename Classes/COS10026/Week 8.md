# Week 8
## Lecture 8. PHP Includes and Managing State
### 1. PHP Includes
   - **Purpose**: Code reuse at file level
     - Facilitates reusing PHP code across multiple files
     - Useful for including recurring functionality or content (e.g., menus, headers, footers)
     - Helps maintain consistency across web pages
     - Reduces code duplication and maintenance effort
   - **include_once vs require**
     - include_once: Includes and evaluates a specified file during execution
       - If the file is already included, it won't be included again
       - Produces a warning but doesn't stop script execution if file is missing
     - require: Same as include but produces a fatal error if file is missing
       - Script execution stops immediately if file isn't found
       - Use when the included file is essential for the script to run
   - **Examples of usage**
     - Including HTML templates
     - Reusing PHP functions
     - Sharing configuration settings
     - Creating modular code structure
   - **File naming conventions**
     - Common extensions: .html, .php, .inc
     - Best practices:
       - Use descriptive names
       - Indicate the purpose of the file
       - Consider using a consistent naming convention
       - Separate reusable components into logical files
   - **Considerations**
     - File path resolution
     - Security implications of including files
     - Performance impact of excessive includes
     - Scope of variables within included files
### 2. Managing State between Client and Server
   - **Understanding State Information**
     - HTTP was designed to be stateless
     - Web browsers don't store persistent data about visits by default
     - Need to maintain state for various web applications
     - State information must be passed between client and server
   - **Reasons for Maintaining State**
     - Multi-page form navigation
     - User preferences customization
     - Shopping cart functionality
     - User authentication and sessions
     - Visit tracking and analytics
     - Bookmarking capabilities

   - **Techniques for Maintaining State**
     - **Hidden Form Fields**
        - Store data in form fields that aren't visible to users
        - Use `<input type="hidden">` in HTML forms
        - Data is sent to server when form is submitted
        - Example: Passing calculation results between pages
        - Considerations: Data is visible in page source, not secure for sensitive information
     - **Query Strings**
        - Append name-value pairs to URLs
        - Format: `url?name1=value1&name2=value2`
        - Automatically used with GET method forms
        - Example: Passing user information between pages
        - Considerations: Data is visible in URL, length limitations, security concerns
     - **Sessions**
        - Server-side storage of state information
        - Unique session ID identifies each user's session
        - Started with `session_start()`
        - Data stored in `$_SESSION` superglobal
        - Example: User authentication and personalized content
        - Considerations: Session management, security, timeout settings
   - **Comparison of Techniques**
     - Visibility: Hidden fields and query strings are client-side visible; sessions are server-side
     - Security: Sessions generally more secure for sensitive data
     - Persistence: Sessions can maintain state across multiple page requests
     - Implementation Complexity: Sessions require more setup than hidden fields or query strings
   - **Best Practices**
     - Use sessions for sensitive or important state information
     - Combine techniques when appropriate
     - Consider security implications of each method
     - Validate and sanitize all incoming state information
     - Handle session expiration and cleanup appropriately

## Maintaining Session Information

### Technology Stack Options
#### **Cookies**
 - Small text files stored in the user's browser
 - Sent with every HTTP request to the server
 - Can be persistent (with expiration date) or session-based
 - Limited to about 4KB per cookie
 - Accessible via JavaScript and server-side code
 - Commonly used for authentication tokens and user preferences
 - Security considerations: Vulnerable to XSS and CSRF attacks if not properly secured
 - Can be marked as HTTP-only to prevent JavaScript access
 - Supports domain and path specifications

#### **Session Storage**
 - Part of the Web Storage API
 - Stores data only for the duration of a page session
 - Isolated to a single tab/window
 - Data is not automatically sent to the server
 - Larger storage capacity than cookies (typically 5-10MB)
 - Accessed via JavaScript
 - Best for temporary data needed during a single session
 - Automatically cleared when the tab/window is closed
 - Simpler to use in client-side scripts

#### **Local Storage**
##### Local Storage. Info
 - Also part of the Web Storage API
 - Stores data with no expiration date
 - Data persists across sessions and browser restarts
 - Larger storage capacity (typically 5-10MB)
 - Accessed via JavaScript
 - Suitable for storing user preferences, application state, etc.
 - Data is not automatically sent to the server
 - More secure than cookies for certain use cases
 - Example implementation in JavaScript
 
##### Local Storage. Example
```
sessionStorage.setItem("username", "John");  
const username = sessionStorage.getItem("username");
```

#### **Server-side Sessions**
##### Server-side Sessions. Info
 - Data stored on the server
 - Associated with a unique session ID sent to the client
 - Typically managed by server frameworks/libraries
 - More secure for sensitive data
 - Can be combined with cookies to store the session ID
 - Requires server resources to maintain session data
 - Commonly used for user authentication and personalized content
 - Session data is stored in memory or databases
##### Server-side Sessions. Example
```js
// Simulate a login (for demonstration purposes)
if (isset($_GET['login'])) {
	$userId = 123; // Replace with your user authentication logic
	$_SESSION['user_id'] = $userId;
	echo "You are now logged in as User ID: $userId";
}

// Simulate a logout (for demonstration purposes)
if (isset($_GET['logout'])) {
	session_unset(); // Unset all session variables
	session destroy(); // Destroy the session
	echo "You are now logged out.";
}
?>

	<title>Server-side Sessions Example</title>
</head>
<body>
	<a href="login">Log In</a> | <a href="?logout">Log Out</a>
</body>
</html>
```

#### **Databases**
 - Persistent storage for session data
 - Can be relational (e.g., MySQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB)
 - Requires server-side implementation
 - Suitable for complex data structures and long-term storage
 - Often used in conjunction with server-side sessions
 - Provides durability and data integrity
 - Can be scaled for high-traffic applications

 ##### Example
 - Storing session data in a MySQL database table

### Cookies vs Session Storage

| Aspect               | Cookies                                                                 | Session Storage                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope of Data**    | Sent with every HTTP request to same domain; accessible client/server-side; can specify domain/path | Isolated to single tab/window; not sent with HTTP requests; restricted to same origin/tab |
| **Storage Limitations** | ~4KB per cookie; total cookies per domain limited                      | ~5-10MB total; no per-item limitations                                          |
| **Lifetime**         | Can persist beyond session with expiration date; session cookies last until browser closes | Data cleared when tab/window closes; only available during page session         |
| **Use Cases**        | Authentication tokens, tracking, preferences across sessions/tabs       | Temporary data during single session; form data; short-term application state   |
| **Access and Manipulation** | Accessed via JavaScript (document.cookie) and server-side HTTP headers; built-in security options | Accessed via JavaScript (sessionStorage object); simpler API; no server-side access |
| **Security**         | Vulnerable to XSS/CSRF; can be marked HTTP-only; secure flag prevents HTTP transmission | More secure; data not sent to server; isolated to origin/tab; not vulnerable to CSRF |

### Server-Side Sessions

- **Definition**: Storing session data on the server rather than on the client's browser
    
- **How They Work**:
    
    - Server generates a unique session ID for each user
        
    - Session ID is typically stored in a cookie, URL parameter, or form field
        
    - Server associates the session ID with session data stored in memory or a database
        
    - Each subsequent request from the client includes the session ID, allowing the server to retrieve the associated session data
        
- **Implementation**:
    
    - Most server-side frameworks provide built-in session management (e.g., PHP sessions, Express.js session middleware)
        
    - Requires configuring session storage (memory, file system, database)
        
    - Session data is typically serialized and stored
        
    - Example PHP implementation using `session_start()`
        
- **Advantages**:
    
    - More secure for sensitive data as it's never exposed to the client
        
    - Larger storage capacity compared to cookies
        
    - Better control over session expiration and security
        
    - Data is not transmitted with every request (only the session ID)
        
- **Considerations**:
    
    - Server resources required to maintain session data
        
    - Session management for scalability and fault tolerance
        
    - Session persistence across server restarts
        
    - Security measures to prevent session hijacking
        
- **Use Cases**:
    
    - User authentication and personalized content
        
    - Shopping cart implementation
        
    - Multi-step form processing
        
    - Storing temporary user-specific data
        
- **Security Best Practices**:
    
    - Use secure cookies to transmit session IDs
        
    - Implement session timeout
        
    - Regenerate session IDs after privilege changes (e.g., login)
        
    - Store minimal sensitive information
        
    - Implement proper session cleanup

### Local Storage

#### **Definition**: Client-side storage mechanism with persistent data storage
#### **Characteristics**:
 - Part of the Web Storage API
 - Stores data as key-value pairs
 - Data persists across sessions and browser restarts
 - Larger storage capacity (typically 5-10MB)
 - Data is not automatically sent to the server
#### **Implementation**:
 - Accessed via JavaScript using the `localStorage` object
 - Simple API for storing, retrieving, and removing data
 - Example: `localStorage.setItem('key', 'value')`
 - Data is stored as strings; complex data requires serialization
#### **Advantages**:
 - Persistent storage without server round-trips
 - Larger storage capacity than cookies
 - Simple API for client-side storage
 - Data survives browser restarts
 - Reduces server load for certain types of data
#### **Limitations**:
 - Data is stored as plain text
 - No expiration mechanism (must be managed manually)
 - Limited to same-origin policy
 - No automatic data synchronization between tabs/windows
#### **Security Considerations**:
 - Vulnerable to XSS attacks if not properly secured
 - Data is accessible across all tabs/windows for the same origin
 - Should not be used for sensitive information
 - Implement proper input validation and sanitization
#### **Use Cases**:
 - Storing user preferences and settings
 - Caching frequently accessed data
 - Offline web applications
 - Form auto-fill and draft saving
 - Personalizing user experience
#### **Comparison to Cookies**:
 - Larger storage capacity
 - Data not sent with every request
 - Persistent storage without expiration dates
 - Not accessible server-side without explicit transmission
#### **Comparison to Session Storage**:
 - Data persists beyond session
 - Shared across all tabs/windows for the same origin
 - Larger storage capacity
#### **Example Implementation**:
 ```javascript
 // Storing data
 localStorage.setItem('username', 'john_doe');
 localStorage.theme = 'dark'; // Alternative syntax
 
 // Retrieving data
 const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
 const theme = localStorage.theme;
 
 // Removing data
 localStorage.removeItem('username');
 
 // Clearing all data
 localStorage.clear();
 ```


### Databases

####  **Definition**: 
- Persistent storage systems for organizing and managing large amounts of structured data
    
#### **How They Work for Session Storage**:
    
- Session data is stored in database tables/collections
	
- Each session is identified by a unique session ID
	
- Server retrieves session data from database using the session ID provided by the client
	
- Data can be structured in various ways depending on the database type
        
#### **Implementation**:
    
- Requires server-side code to handle database connections and queries
	
- Can use relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis)
	
- Need to design appropriate data models for session storage
	
- Example: Creating a sessions table with columns for session ID, data, and expiration timestamp
        
#### **Advantages**:
    
- Persistent and durable storage
	
- Scalability for high-traffic applications
	
- Complex data structures can be easily managed
	
- Better security for sensitive data compared to client-side storage
	
- Session data can be shared across multiple servers ( beneficial for load-balanced environments)
        
#### **Considerations**:
    
- Additional complexity in implementation and maintenance
	
- Performance considerations for frequent session data access
	
- Database connection management
	
- Session expiration and cleanup processes
	
- Security measures for database access
        
#### **Use Cases**:
    
- Applications requiring persistent session data
	
- Multi-server or cloud-based architectures
	
- Applications with complex session data structures
	
- Systems requiring audit trails or session monitoring
        
#### **Security Best Practices**:
    
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
	
- Encrypt sensitive session data
	
- Implement proper access controls
	
- Regularly backup and maintain database
	
- Use appropriate indexing for session ID lookups
        
#### **Comparison to Other Methods**:
    
- More persistent than cookies, session storage, and local storage
	
- Better for complex data structures than simple key-value storage
	
- Requires server resources unlike client-side storage
	
- More secure for sensitive data than client-side options
        
#### **Example Implementation**:

```php
// Connecting to MySQL database
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Starting session and saving to database
session_set_save_handler(
	new DatabaseSessionHandler($conn)
);
session_start();

// Using session data
$_SESSION['user_id'] = 123;
```




### Example of Local Session Storage using JavaScript
#### **Basic Implementation**:
    
- Using `localStorage` API
	
- Storing simple data types
	
- Example:
	
	
	
	```javascript
	// Storing data
	localStorage.setItem('username', 'john_doe');
	localStorage.theme = 'dark'; // Alternative syntax
	
	// Retrieving data
	const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
	const theme = localStorage.theme;
	
	// Removing data
	localStorage.removeItem('username');
	
	// Clearing all data
	localStorage.clear();
	```
    
#### **Storing Complex Data**:
    
- Using `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`
	
- Example:
	
	
	
	```javascript
	// Storing an object
	const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 30, email: 'john@example.com' };
	localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));
	
	// Retrieving the object
	const storedUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));
	```
	
#### **Use Cases**:
    
- User preferences and settings
	
- Form auto-fill and draft saving
	
- Offline web applications
	
- Caching frequently accessed data
	
- Personalizing user experience
        
#### **Best Practices**:
    
- Avoid storing sensitive information
	
- Be mindful of storage limits (~5-10MB)
	
- Implement data versioning for complex data
	
- Use try-catch blocks when parsing JSON
	
- Consider using wrapper functions for common operations
        
#### **Event Handling**:
    
- Listening for storage events
	
- Example:

	```javascript
	window.addEventListener('storage', function(event) {
	  console.log('Storage changed:', event.key, event.newValue);
	});
	```

#### **Security Considerations**:
    
- Vulnerable to XSS attacks
	
- Data is accessible across all tabs/windows
	
- Implement proper input validation
	
- Avoid storing authentication tokens
        
#### **Comparison to Cookies**:
    
- Larger storage capacity
	
- Data not sent with every request
	
- Persistent storage without expiration dates
	
- Not accessible server-side without explicit transmission
        
#### **Comparison to Session Storage**:
    
- Data persists beyond session
	
- Shared across all tabs/windows
	
- Larger storage capacity
        
####  **Advanced Techniques**:
    
- Implementing auto-save functionality
	
- Creating a wrapper class for storage operations
	
- Using IndexedDB for larger data storage needs
	
- Implementing encryption for sensitive data
	
- Creating backup systems with multiple storage fallbacks

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Mindmap

### 1. Introduction to XSS
   - **Definition**: Security vulnerability in web applications
     - Occurs when attackers inject malicious code (usually JavaScript) into web pages
     - The injected code executes in other users' browsers
     - Compromises user data or interactions with the application
   - **Mechanism**:
     - Attackers find input points in web applications (forms, URLs, etc.)
     - Inject malicious scripts that are not properly sanitized
     - When victims access the compromised page, the script executes in their browser
   - **Execution Context**:
     - Runs within the victim's browser security context
     - Has access to cookies, session tokens, and can perform actions as the victim
   - **Scope and Prevalence**:
     - One of the most common web application vulnerabilities
     - Found in many types of web applications, especially those with user-generated content
   - **Relationship to Other Vulnerabilities**:
     - Similar to SQL injection but targets clients instead of servers
     - Often exploited in combination with other vulnerabilities
   - **Real-World Examples**:
     - Social media platforms with comment sections
     - E-commerce sites with product reviews
     - Web applications with search functionality
   - **Historical Context**:
     - First identified in the early 2000s
     - Has evolved with web technologies
     - Remains a significant concern despite awareness

### 2. Types of XSS Attacks
- **Stored XSS (Persistent XSS)**
    
    - **Definition**: Malicious script is permanently stored on the target server
        
    - **Mechanism**:
        
        - Attacker injects script into server-side data storage (database, file system)
            
        - Script is served to users who access affected pages
            
    - **Common Vectors**:
        
        - User-generated content areas: comments, forum posts, profile descriptions, product reviews
            
        - Database-stored fields: user profiles, settings, configuration data
            
    - **Technical Details**:
        
        - Payload persists across sessions and users
            
        - Often requires server-side storage vulnerability
            
        - Can affect large numbers of users over time
            
    - **Examples**:
        
        - Social media platform comment sections
            
        - E-commerce product review systems
            
        - Community forum posts
            
    - **Prevention**:
        
        - Sanitize and validate all user input before storage
            
        - Implement proper output encoding when displaying stored content
            
        - Use content security policy (CSP) headers
            
- **Reflected XSS**
    
    - **Definition**: Non-persistent attack where payload is reflected in server response
        
    - **Mechanism**:
        
        - Attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the payload
            
        - Victim is tricked into clicking the link
            
        - Payload executes when the modified page is rendered in the victim's browser
            
    - **Common Vectors**:
        
        - Search forms
            
        - URL parameters
            
        - Error messages
            
        - Any input reflected in server response without proper sanitization
            
    - **Technical Details**:
        
        - Payload is not stored server-side
            
        - Requires social engineering to trick victims
            
        - Limited to single request/response cycle
            
    - **Examples**:
        
        - Malicious links in phishing emails
            
        - Compromised search functionality
            
        - URL-shortening services
            
    - **Prevention**:
        
        - Sanitize and validate all user input
            
        - Encode output when reflecting input in responses
            
        - Implement security headers like CSP
            
- **DOM-based XSS**
    
    - **Definition**: Client-side attack manipulating the Document Object Model
        
    - **Mechanism**:
        
        - Payload modifies the DOM environment
            
        - Malicious code executes when the victim interacts with the modified page
            
    - **Common Vectors**:
        
        - Client-side JavaScript that writes data to the DOM
            
        - Unsafe use of DOM properties like innerHTML
            
        - Event handlers that use unsanitized user input
            
    - **Technical Details**:
        
        - Payload never reaches the server
            
        - More difficult to detect through traditional server-side measures
            
        - Relies on client-side script vulnerabilities
            
    - **Examples**:
        
        - Web applications with dynamic content updates
            
        - Single-page applications (SPAs)
            
        - Pages using unsafe JavaScript practices
            
    - **Prevention**:
        
        - Avoid using unsafe DOM methods
